00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.830
Since debugging on a cluster is hard,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.789
Spark has a built-in user interface that you can access from your web browser.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.564
This interface, known as the web UI,

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:16.289
helps you understand what's going on in

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.410
your cluster without looking at individual workers.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.030
Spark's web UI is like

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.914
an EKG machine that helps you measure the health of your Spark jobs.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.144
It's a very useful tool for diagnosing issues in your code and your cluster,

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:30.539
but it's just a tool.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.494
You still need to know how to interpret the output and know where to investigate further.

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.984
When a doctor measures the patient's heart rate with an EKG,

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.079
she needs to understand not only how the heart works,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.439
but also how the heart relates to other parts of the human anatomy.

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.024
Understanding the Spark internals like shuffling, DAGs,

00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:50.629
and stages that we discussed in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.575
previous lessons is like Anatomy 101 for your Spark cluster.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:57.260
So, what does the web UI actually show?

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.519
The web UI provides the current configuration for the cluster which

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.795
can be useful for double-checking that your desired settings went into effect.

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.299
The web UI also shows you the DAG,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.634
the recipe of steps for your program that we went through in lesson two.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.305
You'll see the DAG broken up into stages,

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:16.625
and within each stage,

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.709
there are individual tasks.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.774
Tasks are the steps that the individual worker nodes are assigned.

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.250
In each stage, the worker node divides up

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.745
the input data and runs the task for that stage.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:33.350
The web UI only shows pages related to current Spark jobs that are running.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.994
For example, you won't see any pages related to other libraries

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:40.805
like Spark Streaming unless you are also running a streaming job.

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:44.570
Before we actually do a walk-through of the Spark web UI,

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.649
let's talk a bit about how to connect to it.

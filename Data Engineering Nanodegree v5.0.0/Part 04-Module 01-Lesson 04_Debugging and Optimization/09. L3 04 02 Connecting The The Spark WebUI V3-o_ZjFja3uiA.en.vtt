00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.669
Connecting to Spark's web UI is a lot like docking boats.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.500
When boats come to a seaport,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.839
it's useful to have various types of ports so

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.899
that each type of boat can dock efficiently and safely.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.199
For a cruise ship, you'll need a port for passenger loading.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.739
While a cargo ship would need a port equipped with cranes,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.459
and a personal speed boat would only require a small dock or peer.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.765
As a result, they have different ports with different procedures for docking.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:36.490
In the same way, it's useful to have several ways to connect data with a machine.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.885
When you transfer private data through a secure shell known as SSH,

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:43.364
you follow a different protocol than when transferring

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:47.300
public HTML data for a webpage using HTTP.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.709
For this reason, you use different ports: port 22 for SSH and port 80 for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.130
HTTP to indicate that you're transferring data using different networking protocols.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.660
These commonly numbered ports follow a convention that engineers agreed upon.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.379
It's like having an agreed upon layout for each seaport in the world.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:11.869
That way, anyone visiting the city knows where to go even if it's their first time there.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.740
Spark uses several agreed upon ports for sharing information.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:20.254
Some ports are for machines to communicate with each other and aren't intended for users.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:26.310
For example, the Spark master uses port 7077 to communicate with the worker nodes,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890
but you'll never use it.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.075
There are a few common ports that you will use from time to time.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.909
For example, you've already seen that we usually connect to

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.879
Jupyter notebooks on port 8888.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:42.679
Another important port is 4040 which shows active Spark jobs.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.890
But the most useful port for you to memorize is the web

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.445
UI for your master node on port 8080.

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:53.344
The web UI on 8080 shows the status of your cluster,

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:57.064
configurations, and the status of any recent jobs.

00:01:57.064 --> 00:02:01.909
Now that you're familiar with how Spark uses ports and connects to the Spark UI,

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.310
let's take a tour of the UI itself.

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.830
Unless you're perfect and never make mistakes,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.759
you probably ran into some minor bugs in your Spark code during lesson two.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.379
When you're in local mode,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.019
those error show up directly in your Jupyter notebooks,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.449
and you can hunt down the problems pretty quickly.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.619
But once you're working with multiple machines on a distributed cluster,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.650
errors in your code can be very hard to diagnose.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.344
In this part of the lesson,

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:29.939
you'll learn about common Spark bugs including

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.225
errors in your code syntax and issues with your data.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.480
You'll learn how to diagnose these types of errors so that you can correct for them.

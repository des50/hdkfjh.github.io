00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.375
Let's say you've written your Spark program but there's a bug somewhere in your code.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.535
The code seems to work just fine,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:15.390
but you have to remember about lazy evaluation from lesson two.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.269
Spark waits as long as it can before running your code on data,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.554
so you won't discover an error right away.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.230
This can be very different from what you've seen in traditional Python.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.420
Let's look at an example of this delayed feedback.

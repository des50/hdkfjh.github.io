00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.394
You've learned a lot in this lesson.

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:11.519
You made the leap from local mode to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.855
distributed cluster and you also experimented with the distributed storage.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.449
You also learned how to debug your Spark code on

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.035
a cluster using the web UI and accumulators.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:25.050
With these tools, you can catch any spark error,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.370
whether it's in your code,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.800
your data, or your algorithm.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.289
Now that you know how to wrangle data at scale,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.509
you'll use everything you've learned about Spark

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:36.289
to build machine learning models on big data.

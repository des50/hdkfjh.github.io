Even if you have perfectly written code,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.794
your data might have errors like missing values or unexpected Unicode characters.

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.634
These type of issues in the data shouldn't crash your program.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.510
Let's say you extract a few smaller datasets to see if your code runs error-free.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.785
Everything seems to be running fine and your code has no syntax issues.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.309
Next, you run your Spark code on the full dataset and

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.109
the same code that worked before throws an error. What happened?

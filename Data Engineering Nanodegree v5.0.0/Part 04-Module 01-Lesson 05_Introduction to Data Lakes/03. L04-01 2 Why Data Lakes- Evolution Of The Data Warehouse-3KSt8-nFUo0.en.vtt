00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.000
So initially, we had the data warehouse,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.320
and one might ask,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.650
is there anything wrong with the data warehouse that we need something different?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.285
But, there's nothing wrong per se.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.714
Data warehouse is really mature, tried-and-true.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:22.050
I mentioned modeling is extremely relevant to this day.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.205
For many organizations, data warehouse is still the best way to go,

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.859
perhaps the only thing that needs to be

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.619
changed is maybe moving to the cloud or something.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.870
But otherwise, still totally relevant.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.500
So why do we need the data lake then?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.469
The idea is that in recent years,

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.740
there are some factors drove the evolution of the data warehouse.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.609
For example the abundance of unstructured data.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.174
A lot, not everything is tabular.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:01:00.890
There are unprecedented data volumes like social network dumps and censored data and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.840
machine-generated stuff that comes from like

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.390
your smartwatch or things of that sort.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:16.519
Then meanwhile also, we have seen a rise

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:20.179
of the big data technologies like HDFS and spark.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.510
These became enablers for new opportunities.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.260
Also, certain types of analyses that we're

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.570
not really that popular before like predictive analytics based on machine learning

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:44.250
and recommended systems and graph analytics became actually more topical and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.349
also we had new roles in the organization so that the data warehouse audience were

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:53.769
basically the business users that needed to make decisions and gain insights.

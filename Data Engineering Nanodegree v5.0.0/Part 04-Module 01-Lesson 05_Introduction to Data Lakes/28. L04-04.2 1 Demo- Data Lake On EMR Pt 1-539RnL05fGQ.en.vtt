00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.269
So, now we're going to work with an actually a real Hadoop cluster,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.054
and if you go here to Elastic MapReduce,

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:17.009
you get the ability to create actual Hadoop clusters.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.120
These are past old clusters which are terminated.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.615
So, if I say create cluster here and I go,

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:26.714
I can pick the name of my cluster,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:34.439
I can pick how many nodes do I want and the instance types and how many nodes do I want.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:39.030
Here also, let's say it's three nodes, no problem.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.039
You also take care that you also,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.969
like any EC2 machine if you want to SSH to that,

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.454
you'd pick a key pair.

00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.289
But what's important here is that,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.674
when you go to the Advanced Options and click what you want to work with,

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:56.074
you get to choose what to install.

00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:00.210
So, you can put Hadoop and that's would give you an HDFS.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.890
You can put Hive,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.150
you can put Spark and you can put Zookeeper and so

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.510
forth and actually you can do like this,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.190
you can do whatever you like.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.939
I'm going to go back to the to the quick options.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.390
You can also set up a cluster that will be

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.185
up and running or you can do it as a step execution which means,

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.784
from another scripts, you are going to

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:29.000
just launch this to do something and it closes again.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.129
Anyhow, we're not going to do the cluster,

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:32.944
not the step execution at the moment.

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.509
This is just to show you that you can do that.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.825
We're going to do something much nicer here which is the ability to have notebooks,

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.350
normal notebooks and for the notebooks,

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.989
these notebooks actually, themselves are saved in S3.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:54.390
For the notebook, while creating it can launch a cluster for you.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.430
So, we're going to say,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.865
Data Lake Demo, perhaps.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:04.519
We choose an existing cluster that we built before or we create

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:10.894
a cluster and we're going to call it the Data Lake Cluster.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:13.085
The default thing is that it has Hadoop,

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:18.965
Spark and Livy which provides a web interface that makes working with the,

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:23.310
I mean, web much easier with Spark.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.420
But we don't care about that,

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.679
we care about Hadoop and Spark.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.770
Actually, now we're going to use only Spark.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.590
Instance one is enough.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.164
If you're doing something big,

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:34.409
you really need to crunch,

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.674
you can get more.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:38.780
Here, it has all the default trolls.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.354
You don't need to change that.

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:43.479
You can leave the default security groups,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:49.159
and this is where it's going to save the Python notebook itself.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.155
We create the notebook.

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:57.080
Somehow it has a problem creating a new cluster.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.995
Well, that was a glitch.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:02.375
I'm glad it happened in the demo.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:03.490
I haven't seen it before.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.395
Now you see that it can actually happen.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.750
This is going to stay a while,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.340
I'm going to refresh and hopefully it will open.

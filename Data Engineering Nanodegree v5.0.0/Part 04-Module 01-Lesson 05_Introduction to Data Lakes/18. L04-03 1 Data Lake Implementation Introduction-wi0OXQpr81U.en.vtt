00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
Now we take a look at some internals of the Data Lake.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.919
So, as we said,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.434
the data lakes were empowered by the big data technologies,

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:17.234
and initially, big data technologies worked using the hadoop ecosystem.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.614
Over times the big data tools architecture itself changed and

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:27.629
hadoop is not now the only way to implement big data architectures.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.859
So, we will start by explaining the original idea,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.640
and then in the next section,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
we will explain the different ways of doing data lake on Amazon Web Services.

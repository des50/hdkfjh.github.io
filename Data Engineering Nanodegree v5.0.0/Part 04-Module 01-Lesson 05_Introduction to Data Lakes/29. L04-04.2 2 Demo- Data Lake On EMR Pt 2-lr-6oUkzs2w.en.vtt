00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
Now, that cluster has finally started called the DataLakeCluster,

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:07.229
and I can open the notebook here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.919
Actually, if you just write percent, percent Spark,

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:19.425
Spark will launch for you and you don't need to load the Hadoop AWS library,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.905
like we did in our Local Jupyter notebook here.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.429
That part has already been done for you.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.519
You also do not need to have any access key or secret

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.579
key because you're running this with your credentials.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.664
So, both these steps are not needed if we're working on the EMR notebooks.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:44.890
Finally, we can go ahead right away and write our code like here,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.865
and you write it and it prints a schema and you can see it.

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:55.460
This is actually a proper way of working

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.274
and you can have a big cluster here with many nodes.

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:01.594
The whole point of this,

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.719
is the ability to crunch a huge amount of data.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.819
So, from S3 to the EMR cluster,

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.814
that's a viable solution.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:14.405
If you need to do Spark submit and not done with a Jupyter,

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:17.510
you can actually go to your data cluster here.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:26.150
This is the our cluster and there is a way here to actually have an end point.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.100
You can say enable web connection here,

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.405
it will give you instructions for how to SSH to

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:38.629
this machine with an end point and here's the SSH, I'm sorry.

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:40.824
That's enabled work connections actually,

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:46.415
for monitoring all the services like seeing the Spark, UI, and so on.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:53.110
Here is an endpoint and that you can SSH to if you so wish.

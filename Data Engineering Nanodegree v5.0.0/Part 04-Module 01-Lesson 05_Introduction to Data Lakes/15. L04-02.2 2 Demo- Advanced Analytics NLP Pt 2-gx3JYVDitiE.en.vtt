00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
I'm going to do here is that I'm going to use the NLP library,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:09.705
and this downloads a pre-trained pipeline.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:15.210
This understands the English language and knows a lot about English,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.575
and it can tell you what each word type is.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:23.730
What I go is we get this basic pipeline,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.500
and we say BP which is the basic pipeline of annotate,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.809
and you give it a data frame,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.390
and you say in this data frame,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.429
I'm interested to annotate this column which is the title column.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.369
You get back and annotated data frame that looks like this.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:45.679
I don't know how much you're familiar with NLP.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.759
There are processes like tokenization, lemmatization,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:55.039
normalization, and one of them is called part of speech tagging.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.640
We are going to be interested here in the part of speech tagging,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.965
and let me show you what happens.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.050
It gives you something that looks like that.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.954
So I'm going to select the pulse.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:08.909
So we have here one, two, three, four,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.189
and I want the column which is called pos.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.715
Pos actually is an array,

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:21.609
and it has a struct,

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.810
and the struct has the metadata,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510
so I need this metadata.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.430
So I'm going to select that,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.665
and I'm going to get the list for Microsoft is a word,

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.540
is a word, is a word. I get that.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.230
I didn't need NLP to tell me this.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.219
But here is the interesting part.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.745
It tells me here that this is a proper noun or this is a verb for said, it is a verb.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:56.195
For has, it's a PRP preposition or I don't know, I'm not doing grammar.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:58.179
You have here nouns.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.855
Actually, there is a place where if you Googled part of speech tagging,

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:07.730
you will find that these acronyms exactly what they tell you,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.655
what we are interested in the proper noun like Microsoft,

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:12.860
we're not interested in said,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.730
or it, or has,

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.114
we're interested in the NLP being the nouns,

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:22.760
and the NNS which might be actually plurals of that.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.759
If I remember that terms correctly.

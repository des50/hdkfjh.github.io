00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.673
So the idea in the AWS EMR,

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:05.490
we need to build an EMR cluster,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.910
Elastic Map Reduce, and put HDFS and Spark on it.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.845
So we will have all our nodes,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.960
and our nodes are going to be storage nodes and processing nodes.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.605
The idea is that data would live in the sources initially.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.524
We're going to ingest this data,

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:23.084
and here the ingest,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.269
the data pipe-lining tools are the same,

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:36.530
put them here, and here are the data in various formats all live in this storage.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.420
Once they are ingested,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.649
they are queried in place.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.515
The data doesn't move anywhere else,

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:42.980
the data stays here.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:50.119
Only the results of the our queries come to the BI and the analytics apps.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.109
Also, if this cluster is shut down,

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.939
this means we don't have access to the data.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.340
This is unlike, of course S3,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.440
I mean S3 if something is an S3,

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.684
S3 doesn't shut down.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:03.945
It's always available.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:05.564
So in that case,

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:14.780
here this HDFS cluster becomes these are like any database actually it's on all the time.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.790
Are they not supposed to be on?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.410
Of course, they're supposed to be on.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.599
But that's in contrast to the other mode we're going to see now.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.780
But bottom line is,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.135
here what do we pay?

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:34.495
We pay the cost of having all the EC2 machines on which the EMR cluster is running.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:39.260
So you have to compute the cost of each such node,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.540
of course, if you have these,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.090
these could be as powerful as you want,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.570
and they are always on 24-7 and you need to compute that cost.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Now, we take a closer look at how big data technology affect the data warehousing

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.929
or the aspects of big data technology that had a direct effect on data warehouse.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.724
The first thing is that the low cost of storage.

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.640
Actually, once big data technologies were made

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.675
mainstream or we can say gained industrial grounds,

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.929
the idea that you have the same hardware for storage and processing

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.469
made it very attractive to take this ETL here,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.869
which traditionally was an ETL grid,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.340
was storage and processing nodes and replace that with a big data cluster.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.260
It's not the biggest big data cluster,

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:44.460
but actually it provided a very nice and easier to manage alternative for that.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.210
So, that became known as ETL offloading.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.365
The dimensional model practice was still the same normally,

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:03.740
but the only thing maybe that changed is not only that this replaced the ETL,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.590
the big data cluster, is that there was a little bit of room.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.950
So, this was cheap to get some data which is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.840
a little bit of low or unknown value or you could even say of non-value,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.719
but it would have been very expensive to put it in

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.965
the dimensional model store in those expensive MVPs then we can put them here as well.

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:29.299
So, a little bit of ETL replacement and

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.679
also adding storage into the warehouse with less cost.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So what I want to do here is that I want to take this word,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
this and this, and I want to put them together actually.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.949
So I'm going to explode the pos part here.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.619
This is the pos part,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.785
so I will get it underneath each other.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.184
So if I'm going to get it like this,

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:24.584
so I'm going to get the pos,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.640
and the noun, and the words.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.340
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to filter this on the pos.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.359
and you can see actually that this is pos.result.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.810
So the pos.result has this.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.325
So I want to keep this list,

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:48.600
but only if the post.result,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.550
which is 1, 2, 3,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:57.744
4, like you have here the NNP here is equal to Microsoft,

00:00:57.744 --> 00:00:59.494
is equal to a proper noun.

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:06.334
So I do such that pos result is equal to NNP or pos.result is equal to NNPS.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:10.259
I do that here and I get this list.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.915
Then now I get things which are interesting like Microsoft,

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:14.210
and Corp, and Europe,

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:15.649
and Deutsche Bank, and Bank,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.025
and Trump Organization, Tehran, and so on.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:20.560
Some of them might be,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.340
organization might be less interesting than Corp,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.390
but definitely Trump, and Tehran,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.670
and Microsoft, and Europe are actually things

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.635
that happened in the news that are more telling than in there and so forth.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:45.590
The last thing that we do is actually we go and extract only the word and the results.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.790
So we get the dataframe like this.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.070
Finally, we go and group by which words appeared a lot in the news,

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.564
and we find that US,

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:04.629
Trump, Saudi, Putin, Russia.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.335
So we get a little bit of an idea here about this bunch of news that we got,

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:15.105
actually what are the popular items or the popular keywords in the news,

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:20.369
something that would have not have been easy to do with normal SQL.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.170
But thanks to the fact that we have NLP already within our datalake,

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:32.129
we can do something like that with Spark.

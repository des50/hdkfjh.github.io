00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.474
Now we take a closer look on how to build a data lake on Amazon Web Services.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:11.129
So, basically, what we have to understand what is the storage option,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.825
what does the processing option,

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:18.989
and the kind of the the manager or the unmanaged vendor solution order.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.049
Like we didn't in Redshift and RDS and so forth.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.160
So, the idea that the normal solution which is to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.269
have storage with HDFS and processing with Spark

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.839
and and I would say here maybe you want to replace this with Hive or

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
with any other processing tool that you might

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.079
see like like Flink

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.405
or whatever other processing tool is available on the big data clusters.

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:48.600
And then, you would have to two choices

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.664
either AWS managed solution or the vendor managed.

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:59.729
So, Amazon gives you this AWS elastic MapReduce and it's not the map,

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.914
the Hadoop MapReduce that's like I guess it's a legacy name,

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:05.480
but in elastic MapReduce,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.380
you can choose the components that you want,

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:13.394
and you can choose the HDFS with Spark and that would be a cluster,

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:15.545
and that cluster is elastic.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.105
You can shrink it, you can grow it.

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:19.640
I mean you can do lots of functionality,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.659
add software, you name it.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.969
But also other vendors like Cloudera, Hortonworks,

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:35.189
and Databricks will give you also solutions to work with on the clouds on EC2 machines.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.450
So, you can get easy planning.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.805
In principle you just get bare-metal EC2 machines or,

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:42.890
they're not bare metal, but I mean just have

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.445
operating systems and you can install whatever you like on them.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:51.709
The second option, which is a new way of deploying an AWS solutions,

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.094
which is actually making the storage S3 and the processing Spark.

00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:59.319
And the third is S3 with Serverless,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.839
and perhaps these are not the traditional ways.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.009
This is a little bit an evolution of how things became when we went to the cloud.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.679
So, let me introduce this one first and then we go by delta to see the rest.

Welcome to lesson four, Data Lakes.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.304
In this lesson, we'll understand the need for data lakes,

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:09.599
how they are different from a data warehouse,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.884
and the various options for implementing it on AWS.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:18.644
You need to know the basic knowledge for database design SQL, programming in Python,

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.480
data warehouse architecture, dimensional modelling,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.429
and you should be familiar with AWS services, Spark and HDFS.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.769
So, we will start by knowing why do we need the data lake,

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.460
and then we will go review a little bit,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.350
in a closer look,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.410
the big data technology effect on data warehousing.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.009
And then we will go and see how data lakes work,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.299
and then we will go through the different options

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.019
for implementing a big data lake on AWS.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.850
Finally, we will see what are the current issues with data lakes.

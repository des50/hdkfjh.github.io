00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
As we said, also the new roles,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:07.470
the data warehouse by design followed an extremely well-architected.

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.140
You have very clear roles for the facts,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.614
for the dimensions, for the OLAP cubes,

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:15.270
for the quality, for the consistency,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.030
for who has access to what and so forth.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:27.704
Now, it's becoming more popular that you want to engage new roles like a data scientist,

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.179
who's going to extract value from the data.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.195
The data scientist's job is almost impossible.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:38.549
If you went through this very well-architected and fixed data representation.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:42.869
There needs to be a freedom to basically play with datasets,

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.534
join them differently, re-encode them,

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:51.729
take external data sources and so forth.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.350
That was not possible in the warehouse.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.564
New or larger interest in analytics,

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.289
machine learning and natural language processing and so forth,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.775
these types of analytics, actually,

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:11.515
we're also hard to do on the data warehouse itself.

00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:13.939
While in the big data technologies,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.219
it was possible to have the same hardware which does the storage, does the processing.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.659
That processing also can do the normal mainstream stuff, it can do the exploration,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.250
and it can do those types of new machine learning analytics.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.765
So to sum it up,

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:36.500
the data lake came to this new architecture named the data lake.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.909
You can consider it, actually,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.424
the new data warehouse.

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:43.369
So, the data lake shares the same goals of the data warehouse of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.594
supporting business insights beyond the day-to-day transaction handling.

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:52.890
However, it is there to provide what the data warehouse,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.015
per se in its known form, could not achieve.

00:01:57.015 --> 00:01:59.280
Regarding the various data formats,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.260
the data exploration, the new roles,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.219
and the advanced analytics.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
At this point, you have seen two big ideas in the world of big data engineering.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.205
The first idea being data warehousing,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.914
rather traditional arts for dealing with

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:18.089
the difference between transaction processing and analytical processing,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.539
and a field which is really mature

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.099
over the agents you have lots of tried and true technologies,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.975
and actually that survived the test of many years.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:35.355
Then you have also seen now

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:37.500
the big data technology school of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.204
thought is something that is a little bit more progressive,

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:44.539
where normal commodity machines have been used and

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.289
clustered together to act as a supercomputer which is infinitely scalable.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.079
In this lesson, we're going to see how these two fields

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.019
started to actually come together,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.560
there was a marriage and the big data technology started to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.129
affect the data warehouse until actually,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.045
it started to almost totally revamp it.

00:01:08.045 --> 00:01:10.745
The little strength in that is known as

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:14.579
the data lake which we're going to cover in this lesson.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
So, now that we have had a quiz,

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.775
we're going to modify our DAG with a schedule and date and maximum active runs.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:08.415
Let me go ahead and walk through a demo for you.

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:11.729
So, let me show that lesson one.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.950
Lesson two demo one is off.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.570
Then I'm going to return to my DAGs over

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.589
here and I'm going to open up lesson tow demo two.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.390
All right, so we have our DAG here starting on line 35.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.505
We're going to fill in some information on this DAG.

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.785
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to give it an end date.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:42.654
So, we're going to give it an end date of December 1st.

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:47.804
So, I'm going to say datetime dot datetime 2018,

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:55.945
December 1st, and then I'm going to make sure that I say I have zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:00.530
Again, that's hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.105
Then I'm going to go down and set a schedule interval.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.480
So for this schedule interval I'm going to use monthly.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.289
All right. So now we have a monthly schedule interval.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.530
Finally, I'm going to give it a max active run setting.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.424
I'm going to cover this in just a second but I just want to reiterate,

00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:25.640
we have a start date and an end date.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.558
So what we should see here is that our DAG should run for starting on January 1st,

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:36.844
2018, and should conclude on December 1st, 2018.

00:01:36.844 --> 00:01:40.564
I've also said that the schedule interval should be monthly,

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:43.310
so we should have 12 total runs.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.930
Finally, what is max active runs?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.220
We haven't covered this in the lecture because this is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.950
a particular setting on our schedule.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.920
Max active runs is an argument to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.829
our DAG constructor which tells Airflow that

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.084
I only want one of this DAG to run at a time.

00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:03.829
I'll help you understand this parameter a little

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.265
bit more when we actually visualize this as in the run.

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:10.324
Okay. So flip to edit a DAG,

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:11.784
just going to take a look through here.

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:14.259
Everything looks good. We have our settings

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.949
correct so we've saved and now we're going to open Airflow backup.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.310
So we're going to open lesson two demo three,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.710
pull up the code to make sure that my changes have been reflected.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.605
I can see here that we have 2018-2019 except for this is the wrong DAG, sorry about that.

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.019
Meant to click on lesson two demo two,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.355
so make sure I'm on the right row this time.

00:02:36.354 --> 00:02:38.439
I'm going to click on the code view,

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.270
scroll down a bit here and you can see we have our to-dos filled in here.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.635
So a monthly interval,

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:48.129
December 1st, and max active runs set to 1.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.349
So I'm going to turn to my DAGs menu,

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.495
and I turn-on lesson two demo two.

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.780
I wait a few moments and refresh the page and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.215
we can see that Airflow has already started to schedule our DAG.

00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:03.140
Click into our DAG and you can

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.854
see here that Airflow has picked up that we have a monthly schedule.

00:03:05.854 --> 00:03:11.134
So that's correct. We can see that Airflow is actually starting to run our DAGs.

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:13.840
So I'm going to refresh the page,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.460
and we have our first monthly run complete.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.200
So this took place on,

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.019
you can see the run up there 2018-01-01,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.335
so this is our run for the 1st of January, 2018.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:26.120
If I refresh the page,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.965
we have our second run happening.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:29.840
I'm going to refresh one more time here.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.150
I want to get these to turn, there we go,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.775
turned gray and then we'll get it to turn green.

00:03:34.775 --> 00:03:39.200
Great. So we can see we have a second run here for February 1.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.935
So again, you can see in this black box,

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:44.500
it says run 2018-02-01.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.474
So this is a run for February 1st.

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:51.965
So Airflow is currently back-filling the history of all of these runs.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:56.840
Keep refreshing and so what's really interesting about this is that you

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.370
can just roll over each one of these to see Airflow working on its back-fill.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.655
So we talked about max active runs.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.435
I come back over here, you can see this variable, max active runs.

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.765
What does that mean? What does this do?

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:13.379
So max active runs tells Airflow,

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.859
it's okay to parallelize my tasks.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.480
So in this particular case,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.874
we have four tasks,

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:22.385
but I don't want you to parallelize runs of my DAGs.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:28.545
So I don't want the run for say January 1st and February 1st to happen at the same time.

00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:33.560
This can be important because some analyses depend on data from the previous month.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.125
So I want my January analysis to complete before my February analysis begins.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.319
Max active runs lets you control that.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.949
If you'd like, there are advanced features for the actual tasks and

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.800
operators within your DAG where you can say that you don't want

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.100
more than one copy of a particular DAG running at once but

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.675
often times this kind of parallelization can really speed up your DAG.

00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:02.165
So we're not going to watch the execution of this DAG for too much longer here.

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.430
I want to see if I can catch an example of it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.754
actually parallelizing the execution of our DAGs.

00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:08.790
So here you can see the light green,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.470
this is running, okay?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.890
So I can see here that

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.599
the create trips table and the create stations table tasks are running at the same time.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.410
So we're seeing parallelization of our tasks.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.319
Likewise, I can go to my graph view and I can actually see all of

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.329
the runs and the status of

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.509
those runs and what's really nice is you can see the date built-in here.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.634
So January 1st, February 1st,

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:37.129
March 1st, so on and so forth.

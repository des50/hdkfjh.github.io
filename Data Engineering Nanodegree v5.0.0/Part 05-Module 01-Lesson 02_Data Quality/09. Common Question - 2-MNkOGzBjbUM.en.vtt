00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Great question. So, question was,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.060
"Is time the only type of partition?

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.050
Can we partition on other types of things like an event or a value?"

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.675
Absolutely, there are other types of partitioning.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.895
We're actually going to talk about that shortly.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.759
Specifically, we're going to be talking about

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.609
logical partitioning and also size partitioning or data size partitioning.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.280
You could also partition around events and other types of things, but yes.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.289
Absolutely, time is a common one,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.049
but it's not the only kind of partitioning. Great question.

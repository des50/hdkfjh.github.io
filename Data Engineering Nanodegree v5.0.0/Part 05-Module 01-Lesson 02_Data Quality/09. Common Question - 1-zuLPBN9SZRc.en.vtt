00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Why in creating a new DAG for every feature change

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.185
become cumbersome as feature changes or bugs happen all the time?

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:09.059
The answer to that question is yes,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.575
definitely it can be.

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.094
The question is, and this is,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.710
it really just comes down to the kind of analysis you need to perform as a team.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.890
So, what is the change that I'm making?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.960
Is it a fundamental change to the DAG that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.405
actually changes the meaning of what we're trying to do?

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.020
Or are we adding at something that can be easily

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.054
reflected in the existing data pipeline that we've already designed?

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:34.935
So, if we go back to Airflow,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:38.405
if we were to add say a marketing email send here,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.030
the problem with that is that if we didn't update

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.689
our DAG or rerun the DAG to reflect that,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:49.070
then that can cause issues for other people who might come by later and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.530
think that for the last year

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.289
that this DAG has been running or whatever the time period is,

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.954
we sent all those emails.

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:57.754
But in fact, we haven't, right?

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.185
So, there are a couple of things you can do here.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.164
You could design a new DAG.

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:05.599
Oftentimes that is the simpler solution.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:10.699
The other option which you could explore would be to go in here,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.564
go back to the DAGs page,

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.155
and you can actually clear the history of DAG runs.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.960
So, one way to do that,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.344
if I wanted to rerun lesson two demo one,

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:22.879
I could actually click in here and I can clear the history.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.799
So, let me repeat that.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.744
I went fast. So, on lesson two demo one,

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.314
looking at the recent tasks.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:34.039
So, I'm going to click on the successful tasks.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.160
This takes me to the task instances page,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.314
which shows me all of the successful instances from lesson two demo one.

00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:44.364
You can add or remove filters here.

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:45.905
In this particular case,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.915
I actually going to remove the filter.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:51.335
I just want all tasks related to lesson two demo one.

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:53.734
So, I'm going to do something interesting here.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:57.439
I'm going to actually clear the history of these tasks.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.724
So, I'm going to click apply. Oops, excuse me.

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:05.289
I'm going to hit, going to select all the tests on this page.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.300
I'm going to hit with selected.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.520
And then you see there's some options here.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.355
I can actually change the state of these DAGS.

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:18.039
I'm going to clear them. So, Airflow is going to think that these tasks never run.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:22.060
Okay. So you can see the tasks are back now,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.395
but their state is none.

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.540
So, Airflow is actually going to try to rerun

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.944
these DAGs or rerun these tasks for this DAG.

00:02:28.944 --> 00:02:33.894
Now here's the really important part to keep in consideration when you do this.

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:36.700
Airflow is going to rerun those tasks.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.185
It has no concept of the data stores that you have outside of Airflow.

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:43.670
So, if rerunning a task is

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:47.679
destructive or rerunning a task triggers some kind of downstream action,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.909
this can be really dangerous for

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.240
your internal usage of Airflow and for other data consumers.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.155
So, it is possible to rerun a DAG or to clear the history of a DAG,

00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:00.620
but you as the data engineer need

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.025
to intimately understand the repercussions of doing that.

00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:06.860
So, that's where I bring up the idea that you

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.140
need to really weigh the benefits, the pros and cons,

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.629
between do I need a new DAG altogether,

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.819
where is design with this in mind?

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.044
Or do I need to actually go back and wipe history and try again?

00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:19.530
So, I hope that answer helped.

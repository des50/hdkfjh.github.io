00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
I hope you enjoyed our review of the facets of data quality.

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.089
Today, we covered data lineage and how we can use it

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.564
to understand the movement of data in our pipelines.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.129
We also covered scheduling and how it can be used

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.964
to speed up our analyses and backfill data.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.469
Building on the concepts of using scheduling to speed up analysis,

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:18.989
we learned how to partition data.

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.699
Finally, you saw the role that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.925
good requirements play in determining and measuring data quality.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.285
In lesson three, we'll build on the concepts from lesson one and two,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.399
to learn how to build production quality data pipelines.

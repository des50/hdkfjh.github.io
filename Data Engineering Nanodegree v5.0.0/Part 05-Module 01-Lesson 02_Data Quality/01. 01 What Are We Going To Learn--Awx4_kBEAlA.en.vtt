00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.234
In this lesson, we'll be covering

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:05.564
new concepts and expanding on a few we covered in lesson one.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.759
Students will learn what data lineage is and why it's

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.044
critical to defining and maintaining your data pipelines.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.039
Next, we'll go in depth on

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.869
data pipeline schedules and learn how to

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.689
leverage them to make our pipelines more manageable.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.545
The handle on schedules will be ready to dive in on data partitioning

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.535
and see how partitioning can make our pipelines faster and more reliable.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:31.035
We'll conclude this lesson with an overview of data quality, how it's defined,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.479
and how we can build and test to our data pipelines to

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.399
ensure that our data pipelines are working as intended.

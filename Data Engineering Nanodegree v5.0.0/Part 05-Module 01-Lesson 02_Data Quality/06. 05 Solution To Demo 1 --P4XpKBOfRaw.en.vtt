00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
All right. I hope everyone had fun working on the exercise.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.599
We're going to take a quick look at the solution.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:11.949
So, let me open it up.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.765
I'm going to go down to my solutions.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.144
Lesson two, exercise one. All right.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:22.948
So, as we take a look at the solution,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.935
we're going to recognize that your code looks a little bit different from mine.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.394
So, we're loading the stations' data,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.495
as well as the trip data.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.255
If we go down and take a look at the operators,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:34.635
we can see just like in mine,

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:38.445
you have a create_trips_table, copy_trips_task.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.869
The difference is that you don't have a traffic calculation task,

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:46.625
and instead you're loading a stations_table and a copy_stations_task.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:52.519
I asked you to run the DAG without this second line here first.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.590
Then, to add the second line,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.795
where we have create_stations_table happen,

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:58.825
and then the copy_stations_task.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.859
With both of those changes in place,

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.140
you were able to see the difference in the runs between both of those decks,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.500
which again you should have ended up with something that looks similar to this.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.125
However, you would've had creating the stations_table,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.239
and then finishing the stations_table.

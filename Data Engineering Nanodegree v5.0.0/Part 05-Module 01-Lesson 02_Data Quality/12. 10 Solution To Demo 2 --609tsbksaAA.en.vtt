00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Hopefully everybody had a good time working in exercise two.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.084
I'm going to review the solution with you real quick.

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:09.179
So, we already saw in my demonstration,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.384
how to add a monthly interval.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:14.129
Major difference between the exercise and what I

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.135
demonstrated was the frequency of the runs and how long it was running for.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.515
So, I'm going to go ahead,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:20.910
move back to the code.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.530
I'm going to pull up the solution here.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.054
So, we're looking at lesson two, exercise two.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:29.024
Okay. So, in the code,

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.489
I asked for you to set an end date, February first.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.375
So, your code should look something like this, February one.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.314
Secondly, I asked for a schedule interval of monthly,

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:42.344
and I wanted to use at the max active runs to one.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:46.929
Once you've done that, very similar to what you saw me show in the Airflow UI,

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.130
you would have pulled up the Airflow UI.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.915
Seen lesson two, exercise two,

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:54.585
you would've turned it on.

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.204
Without clicking the run button,

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.524
you didn't need to click this.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.045
Airflow automatically would have backfilled for both January and February.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:06.775
You could click into the DAG and you can see a couple of columns here.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:11.775
Click into the graph view and you can see a graph of those runs.

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:13.655
Now, it's worth mentioning.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.070
If you didn't want to just run through February,

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.159
if you wanted to run through the end of 2018 or even to today,

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.280
you're more than welcome to do that.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.855
For the sake of speed,

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.710
we had you only do a couple of backfills,

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.149
but there's nothing wrong with adding more.

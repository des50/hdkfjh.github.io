00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.929
Amazon Web Services is one of the largest providers in the cloud computing industry,

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.664
with over 140 services in compute,

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:16.634
storage, databases, networking, developer tools, security, and more.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.400
In this lesson, we'll learn about a few essential tools

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.479
and services in AWS and practice using them.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.455
These services can be accessed in three different ways.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.094
The AWS management console,

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:34.949
the command line interface or software development kits,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.560
which can be used in combination.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.310
We'll start with the AWS management console,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.870
which is the web user interface.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:50.449
The AWS CLI is a useful way to control and automate your services with code.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.590
SDKs allow you to easily integrate services with

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.390
your applications through APIs built around specific languages and platforms.

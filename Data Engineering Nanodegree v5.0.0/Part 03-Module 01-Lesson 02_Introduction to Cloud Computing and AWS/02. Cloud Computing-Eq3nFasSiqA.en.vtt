00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.750
So what is cloud computing?

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.920
Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.790
remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.085
manage, and process data,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.255
rather than a local server or a personal computer.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:23.745
The arrival of Cloud computing completely changed the way we deploy our technology,

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:29.475
providing powerful access to instant and scalable computing power to enterprises,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.080
start-ups, and developers alike.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.570
Whether you need servers to host a web application,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.755
reliable storage for your data,

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.420
or machines to train machine learning models,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.970
it's easy to see the advantage of relying on the Cloud,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.990
rather than utilizing your personal computer or local servers.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.920
For one, you no longer have to invest in lots of hardware upfront.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.060
No need to worry about whether you are paying for more than you'll need,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.855
or what to do if you need to scale a lot more later on.

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:06.110
Cloud computing makes this as easy as

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.200
clicking a few buttons to scale your resources up or down.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.860
It's significantly faster provisioning the resources you need through the Cloud,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.565
versus the time it would take to gather and build up the hardware you need,

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:21.560
to provide the same support.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.800
This allows you and your team or company,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.300
to develop and experiment at a much faster rate.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.890
Lastly, you can provide efficient access to your applications around the world,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.410
by spreading your deployments to multiple regions.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Welcome back. In this lesson,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:06.359
we'll be learning about how to build maintainable and reusable pipelines and airflow.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.970
Throughout this lesson, we'll focus on elevating

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.495
your DAGs to reliable, production-quality data pipelines.

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.059
First, we'll cover extending airflow with

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.089
custom plug-ins to create your own hooks and operators.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.414
We'll review how to design task boundaries so that we maximize visibility into our tasks.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:25.574
Then, you'll learn about subDAGs,

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:28.259
and how we can actually reuse DAGs themselves.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.200
We'll conclude with a discussion of monitoring an airflow.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
As we reviewed in lesson one,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.344
Hooks provide a reusable interface to external systems and databases.

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.509
Many companies will have in-house systems or datastores,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.779
that need to be accessed during execution of data pipelines.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.899
In these cases, you should consider creating a custom hook.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.810
For example, a [inaudible] share pipelines would

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.320
eventually need to integrate with analytics information from our email provider.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.515
Here, let's pretend that our email provider is MailChimp.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:30.030
Since we can query our accounts email data over an HTTP API,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.260
we might build a custom hook that interfaces with our email provider.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.629
This would allow us to avoid rewriting the same API access code in many different places.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.995
We could build similar hooks to interface with other common analytics tools,

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:45.799
such as GoogleAnalytics or Segment.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.998
The key idea is that we want to consolidate common interactions

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:54.560
with datastores and systems in a reasonable fashion through custom hooks.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.890
Airflow has a rich and vibrant open-source community,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.679
this community is constantly adding new functionality,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.945
and extending the capabilities of Airflow.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:04.385
As an Airflow user,

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:08.550
you should always check Airflow contrib before building your own Airflow plug-ins,

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.869
to see if what you need already exists.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.100
So before we continue,

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:14.944
I'm actually going to leave the slides here for a moment,

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:17.689
and show you what we have in Airflow contrib.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.295
So in this tab, I'm going to zoom in here.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:26.799
In this tab, you can see that we're in the Apache Airflow repository.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.280
I'm in the folder Airflow, Airflow contrib.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.125
You'll see a link for this in the classroom.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.150
Within this, we'll see a number of folders,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.020
the two that we're going to focus on right now,

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:40.179
are hooks and operators.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.550
First we're going to look at operators.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.004
So we're looking at here are list of community contributed operators,

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:49.854
that's why it's in the contrib folder.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:53.155
It's not necessarily considered part of the core of Airflow,

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:58.855
but these are operators custom plug-ins that have been provided by the community.

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.920
So I'll allow you to peruse this yourself,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.719
but I'll point out a couple that might be very useful to you.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.545
So if we scroll down,

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:11.490
you can see a number of operators.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.729
Something like Mongo to S3 can be really useful,

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.034
if you want to dump records directly out of Mongo to S3.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:26.074
Likewise, there are a number of S3 operators defined here.

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:28.594
If you just want to list an S3 bucket,

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.620
in fact this is something we did in the first lesson.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.735
So if we had used this operator,

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:37.410
you theoretically wouldn't have had to have written any code at all.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.189
Likewise, we have one here for Segment.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.604
On the previous slide, we talked a little bit about using a set custom Segment hook,

00:02:45.604 --> 00:02:47.719
you could also write a custom Segment operator,

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.120
if you had a specific type of work that you had in mind.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.854
Likewise, if you want to start with Spark,

00:02:54.854 --> 00:02:58.159
if you wanted to do something with Spark JDBC, or SQL,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.495
or submit a job to Spark,

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:02.240
you can use these operators and parameterize them

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.525
to actually leverage Spark within your Airflow installation.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.025
So if I click into this real quick,

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:10.425
and we scroll down just a little bit,

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:12.370
you can see that,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.090
the documentation here is pretty good.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.090
You can go to the Airflow website to actually see more,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.310
but you can actually see that there are

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.699
a number of options that you can provide to this operator.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.435
So now we're back in Airflow, Airflow contrib,

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.729
the very top level where we started,

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.054
we're going to jump into the hooks folder.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:33.534
Here, we have a number of hooks,

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:37.400
again community contributed hooks that are incredibly useful.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.485
If you work in Amazon or AWS, Microsoft Azure,

00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:44.854
or in Google Cloud Platform,

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:49.695
there are a number of integrated hooks for the systems that those Clouds provide.

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:56.373
You'll also see that we have integrations for tools like Redshift,

00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:00.129
Segment, and even Slack.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.669
As an Airflow user, you should always check

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.509
Airflow contrib before building your own Airflow plug-ins,

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.939
to see if what you need already exists.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.294
Operators and hooks for common data tools,

00:04:10.294 --> 00:04:12.578
like Apache Spark and Cassandra,

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.009
as well as vendor-specific integrations for Amazon Web Services,

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.914
Azure, and Google Cloud Platform,

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.730
can be found in Airflow contrib.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.439
If the functionality exists,

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.540
and it's not quite what you wanted,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.379
that's a great opportunity to add that functionality through an open source contribution.

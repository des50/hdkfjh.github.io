00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
Throughout this course, we've reviewed the concepts of data pipelines.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.099
We saw how to use Apache Airflow to create robust and reasonable DAGs which

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.449
codified these ideas into a reliable and easy to understand interface.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.384
With these skills, you too are now ready to start building production data pipelines.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:22.570
Thanks again for joining with me on this data pipeline journey. I hope you enjoyed it.

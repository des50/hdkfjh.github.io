00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
The first trick in our bag of tricks or in the distribution styles would be,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.375
to do something called an all distribution style.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:15.554
That would be that the small tables would be replicated on all slices to speed up joints.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.314
So, we say to ourselves, "Hey, well,

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.320
these are 50 rows or 40 rows and why don't we just take

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.149
these and copy them four times to all CPUs.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.699
Okay, we're going to waste a little bit of space,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.649
but who cares, that's not big."

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.434
How common is that case?

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:37.760
Actually, most of the dimension tables are not very big.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:41.210
Some of them might be large dimension tables.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.710
But in general, there are not lots of rows in dimension tables compared to fact tables.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.715
That's actually known as broadcasting.

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.540
So, let's see now what would happen,

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.100
the fact sales table,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
the big table which was done in an even way, is still the same here.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.814
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:05.114
Three, two and so forth.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:07.079
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.719
However, these tables were replicated.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.209
All the store dimension was replicated all of it.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.549
In that case, to do the join,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.289
we would look here,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.520
the two we have it,

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:20.989
the three we have it,

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.119
the three we have it, the two we have it,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.710
the four we have it, the five we have it and sometimes this is known as

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:33.339
a lookup table because you can actually access that very quickly.

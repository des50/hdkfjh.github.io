00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
Now, we are very handy with our Redshift cluster.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:10.800
Actually, the click and fill away or the more sophisticated,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.080
the Infrastructure as Code way.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.419
We know how to fill data,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.254
we know how to migrate data or ingest inside redshift with all the associated tricks.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:25.049
Now, we're moving into a part where we want to optimize

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
the design of our tables where we ingest data,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.340
and that's basically for speeding up queries.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.710
So, when a table is partitioned,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.570
we understand we have a big tables,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.600
and the tables are partitioned into smaller partitions so that we

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.885
can access them in parallel or we can parallelize them on slides.

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:52.015
But, the idea is when we chop up those tables,

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.825
the default way is actually to do them blindly.

00:00:55.825 --> 00:01:01.880
So, if one has an idea about the frequent access pattern of a table,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.120
one can choose a more clever strategy.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.025
The two possible strategies are distribution style and sorting key.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:13.130
So let's speak about those.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
The good news is as follows.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.830
If we went for example and started to focus a little bit on the storage parts,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.625
the part where we store all our either data marts

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:16.530
or a fully-fledged conformed dimension data warehouse,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.950
and we decide that we're going to the cloud.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.704
Then, from that actually path,

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.284
we have two also important paths.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:29.204
We can either go cloud-managed or we can go self-managed.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:33.269
Cloud-managed would be that we actually reuse

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.460
the expertise of Amazon which has administered lots of machines.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.810
Self-managed means we just get an EC2 machine and we self-managed it ourselves.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.490
Of course, shall we go this way, the cloud-managed way,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.730
we have a very important advantage because our OpEx goes really

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.594
down because lots of our system administrators and DevOps staff will be much less.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:06.260
For the complexity, actually the good news is we have techniques like infrastructure of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.090
code where we can actually script all our resources.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.680
The downside is that we lose a little bit of control because things are already

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.990
pre-configured for us and there might not be room to do like really custom settings.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.859
But hey, if all fails or we need something really advanced,

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.144
then we can always go to the EC2.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:32.170
That's our catchall phrase actually for that case.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.150
So, for the storage,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.859
we will go cloud and then we will go cloud-managed.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.239
Once we go cloud-managed,

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:40.354
actually we have also lots of options.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.850
We have SQL, or no SQL, or files.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.490
We are going the SQL way for the data warehouse.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:52.679
Actually, if you go to manage SQL,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.700
you will find two products.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.819
You'll find Amazon relational data stores and the Amazon Redshift,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.600
and we are picking this one,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.709
the Amazon Redshift which is SQL based and it's columnar,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.310
and it's massively parallel which we'll explain shortly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
I have a couple of final remarks at

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.315
the end of this lesson and the idea being the following;

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.339
Where should we go from here?

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.044
I believe we covered with enough depth all the cornerstones

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:16.379
of a data warehouse and its implementation on Amazon Web Services.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.439
That said there is a part which is the data flow tools.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600
The data flow tools actually deserve

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
their own focus and there would be an upcoming lesson on this.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.265
So apart from the data flow tools,

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.609
we have actually covered the storage,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.214
the table design, optimizing the table design,

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:36.840
optimizing the ETL all the context of how things work for ETL,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.545
in general the sources and so on.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.640
How to build your cluster automated by using the GUI.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.954
That part deserves its own attention and you would see in an upcoming lecture,

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:49.094
the data flow tools.

00:00:49.094 --> 00:00:53.780
After that when we master data flow tools which we complete the picture with,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.549
actually the data warehouse is a very mature and I don't want to say old.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.619
I want to say mature because there are lots of architecture,

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.034
lots of books, lots of people trained,

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:06.390
lots of companies, lots of technologies.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.575
However, the nature of big data was larger volumes, more unstructured data,

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.140
higher speed and lower quality,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.355
and the classical data warehouse is actually evolving.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.000
So, we studied the architecture

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.439
as the other classic architecture when it moved to the Cloud.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.170
But I want to stress here that actually there is actually

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.204
a very strong evolution going on to the data warehouse.

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:37.640
Namely the concept of a data lake and you will know

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.269
about that also in an upcoming lesson. Thank you.

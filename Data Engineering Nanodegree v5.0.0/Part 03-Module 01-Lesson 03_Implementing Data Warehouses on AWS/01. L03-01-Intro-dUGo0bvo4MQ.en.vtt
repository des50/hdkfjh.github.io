00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.905
Welcome to Lesson Three,

00:00:01.905 --> 00:00:05.384
Data Warehouse on Amazon Web Services.

00:00:05.384 --> 00:00:09.179
In this lesson, our objective is to be able to implement

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.333
a data warehouse on AWS and that includes the storage,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:17.984
the ETL, the design of the tables and the query optimization.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.594
The prerequisites for this lesson is

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.399
a basic knowledge of relational database design and SQL,

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.969
a bit of programming in Python, Lesson One,

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.299
which was actually dimensional modeling and creating OLAP cubes.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.000
Basic ETL in Python like moving data from a table to another table and changing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.375
the the modeling and also basic knowledge of Amazon Web Services,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.729
the IAM service, the VPC,

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.269
the virtual private cloud, S3 and EC2.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.400
Okay, so this is our agenda for this course.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.500
Basically we need to understand what would be

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.350
the motivation of moving a data warehouse to the cloud

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.325
and the product of Amazon which is known as Redshift,

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.609
what's the architecture of that product,

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.929
which is going to be a central piece of our architecture.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.115
Then we will go through basic general ETL concepts.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:19.329
Then we will focus on ETL in the concept of Redshift and then we'll

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.609
have two demos where we build a Redshift cluster in two different ways.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.739
Then finally we go in little bit more into

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:31.989
an advanced part where we review the design of the tables.

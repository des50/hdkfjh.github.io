00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Now, we understand the Redshift architecture,

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.820
we understand how ETL is going to work to Redshift.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.260
We want to focus a little bit on actually building the actual cluster.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.719
So, let's build our first Redshift cluster,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.949
and to do that,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.739
we can actually simply do it with the click of a button

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.445
almost and that will be your first exercise In this lesson.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.530
I will also try to demo it for you.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.250
For all our work is very important that we assume that they're going to be working in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.179
the Oregon AWS region and in the us-west-2.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.439
So, the idea is you go and pick the Redshift service,

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.619
and there you click quick launch.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.599
Okay. So, once you hit quick launch button,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.880
you come here and the most important thing to note here is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.570
the type of machine you are choosing for the cluster.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.480
Actually, we're going to work with the dc2 large,

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.414
that's actually the cheapest of them,

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:58.625
and we're going to have actually here four machines.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.890
Actually, in the beginning for the quick launch cluster

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.450
because we're going to spin it and close it down,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.890
even one or two would be okay,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219
but for all the exercises actually,

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.390
if we're going to do real work,

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.504
we're going to spend four of these.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.979
You can put a cluster identifier,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.450
your username and password,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.060
and that's the port,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530
and you just click launch cluster.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.090
Once you do that,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.109
it takes three or four minutes for this to turn on.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.340
Then, you will have a button here called the query editor,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.659
and you open it,

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.780
and once you open it,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.570
you will find a sequel window here where you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.929
can actually start executing your statements.

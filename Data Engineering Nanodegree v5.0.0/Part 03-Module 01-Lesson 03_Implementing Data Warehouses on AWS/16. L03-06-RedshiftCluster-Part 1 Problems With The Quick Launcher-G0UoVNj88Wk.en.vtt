00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
Coming to the big picture here,

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:05.160
we find that this is the Redshift cluster that we want to do.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.480
But in our case,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.335
there is a couple of small problems with our quickly launched cluster.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:14.040
So, from all backward we are actually concerned

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.000
in our exercise here with these two connections.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.739
So, what's with that?

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.184
So, the idea is that we said the Redshift is going to pull data from S3.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:26.804
Now, S3 is sitting there,

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.679
doesn't know actually who's coming,

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.890
and finally, find a read request from Amazon Redshift.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.725
And who's Amazon Redshift? It doesn't know.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:40.500
So, Amazon Redshift needs actually to do what's known as impersonating a role,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.715
impersonating someone who has access to S3.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:48.460
So, we have to configure Amazon Redshift to do that.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.530
We basically do that by creating an IAM role,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.600
which you should have covered in lesson two,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.030
and you need to have an IAM role that actually has the privilege or has a policy,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.554
to have at least read only access to S3.

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:05.450
The second problem actually is by default,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.170
the Amazon Redshift is only available security wise to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.409
other nodes inside the virtual and private cluster

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.664
or virtual private cloud we said the VPC.

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.745
So, Amazon Redshift is launched within a VPC,

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.660
and the default security group settings is

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.045
actually for that this Redshift to be visible within the security group.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:30.719
We are going to run our work from Jupyter Notebooks to access this one.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.618
So, we need to be able to access from the outside

00:01:33.618 --> 00:01:36.469
and not only for the sake of our exercises,

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.810
in many occasions you would be also interested

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.915
in accessing the warehouse from the outside.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.450
I would say that also in other cases you wouldn't

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.284
want to do that and you want to have that tight security.

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.728
But if you want to access it from the outside,

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:52.760
you need to open a TCP port here to be able to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.484
establish a connection from the outside to the inside.

00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:58.454
So, to sum it up,

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:02.679
building a Redshift cluster using the quick launcher,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.990
is fully functioning but we need a little bit more functionality.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.299
So, we need the security settings.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.640
We need to actually lower the node just a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.609
bit to be able to access the cloud from the outside,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.560
and we also need to impersonate a user who has read access to S3.

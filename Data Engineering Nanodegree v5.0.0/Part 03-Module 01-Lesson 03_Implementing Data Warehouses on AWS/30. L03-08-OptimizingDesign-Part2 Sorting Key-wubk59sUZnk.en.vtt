00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
Now we go into another trick which is the sorting key.

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:07.184
One can actually define columns as a sort key,

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:10.184
and if we chose one column to be as a sort key,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.480
what does that mean that upon loading,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.304
rows are sorted before distribution to slices.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:20.594
So that minimizes the query time since each node

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:25.320
already has contiguous ranges of rows based on the sorting keys.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.519
It's useful for columns that you order or buy a lot.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.015
A column can be both a disk key and a sort key, it can happen.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:34.710
Or you can have different ones,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.219
and actually sometimes they can work against each other.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.229
But the point of this is that,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.659
if you're going to do a lot of order or buy,

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.969
you probably be better mark that as

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.239
a sort key and usually that happens in the fact tables.

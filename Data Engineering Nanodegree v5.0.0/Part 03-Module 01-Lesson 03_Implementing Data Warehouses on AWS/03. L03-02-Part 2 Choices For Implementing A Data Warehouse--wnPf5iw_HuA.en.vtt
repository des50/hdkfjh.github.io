00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
So, what are the ways to go? What are our choices?

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.599
Well, basically, we have either the cloud or the on-premise,

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.679
or on-prem for short.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.744
If we take the on-prem road,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.834
we have to think about heterogeneity,

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:16.719
scalability, and elasticity of the tools.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:23.179
While heterogeneity is rather clear and scalability because we're going to add and add.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.550
Over time, our data storage is going to become bigger or will have bigger needs.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.704
Elasticity means the idea that you actually one day you need that you can not only grow,

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.714
but you can grow and shrink the amount of resources that you need.

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.330
Of course, you should not also think of the resources only,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.625
but you should think of the IT staff skills and all the location as we said previously.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.835
Most importantly, the cost of ownership.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:00.120
I mean, this is the road where you buy stuff.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.140
As opposed to the cloud road where you have

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.120
a lower barrier to entry because you don't buy, effectively, you rent.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.410
You can always change your opinion if you don't like something.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.804
You made a wrong decision,

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:14.590
we can change it easily.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.540
Of course, scalability and elasticity are out of the box.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.505
We can simply add and remove resources.

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:24.769
Usually, a clear criticism sometimes for

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:27.739
the cloud is the idea that the operational costs are high.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:31.324
So, this is to compare for example if you rent an apartment,

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.890
you might be paying a high rent that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.594
you might as well have bought an apartment from scratch.

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:40.265
That might indeed be the case of course.

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.620
The complexity and heterogeneity

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.200
is not going to disappear because we went through the cloud.

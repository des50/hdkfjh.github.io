00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.059
Okay. So, why would we actually implement the data warehouse on AWS?

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.129
This is the conceptual model that we have of a data warehouse.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.190
We have the data or sources that are crucial for operations for OLTP.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
These are quite heterogeneous,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.535
different types, different skill sets.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.359
Each one of them might need different upgrades and it might

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.335
be scattered across the organization in different physical locations.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:33.240
As well, we have the ETL.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.775
Here, it looks like a simple arrow,

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:38.439
but actually, this is a number of processes.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:43.909
Sometimes, a number of machines called a grid of ETL grids.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.919
These ones contain lots of scheduling and pipelining for copying the data

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.590
from the data sources into the dimensional model store.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.150
Then, we have the data warehouse storage part where basically,

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.574
it grows over time.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:02.630
There are different workloads.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.890
Some need one machine and some need many machines.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.359
I mean, one day,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.879
I could need a humongous computation.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:14.049
The other day, maybe I'm doing normal daily computation.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.340
I mean, the end of the year might not be like

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.270
the end of the months or the end of the day.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.159
Then, finally, we need to somehow take

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.099
this data and present it in business intelligent apps,

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:26.869
and visualizations, and so on.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.200
That's also a rather hybrid environment.

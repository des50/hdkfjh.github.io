00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
So, as an example,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.685
you can start with this dc1.large,

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.925
and dc1.large has two CPUs,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.890
and thus, it has two slices.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.759
It has 15 gigabytes of RAM,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.365
and you have 160 gigabyte solid-state drive.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:24.570
You can have from one to 32 in a cluster from these,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.780
and that would give you a total capacity of something like five terabyte.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.005
You can go and get even more low latency NVMe disks.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.670
The latency of that is closer to memory,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.635
if my hardware knowledge is not failing me here.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:52.144
Then, we have also another breed of what's known as the storage-optimized nodes.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:56.845
The storage-optimized nodes actually are not as fast and powerful in terms of CPU,

00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:59.850
but they are larger in capacity.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.700
You can have up to two petabytes.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.980
One of those has 36 CPUs,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.219
and you can have 128 of those,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.775
and you can make your two petabyte.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:21.109
It's also actually worth mentioning here the costs of doing that.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.549
So, these instances are actually rather expensive compared

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.409
to the average EC2 that you can find on Amazon.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.394
You will find, for example, that the dc2.large,

00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:36.750
the start of the offering here,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.189
is for 25 cents per hour.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.579
Bottom line is, when we're going to do

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.965
our demo and when you're going to do your assignments,

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.939
we will actually use four of those.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.620
So, you will be paying a dollar per hour for those machines,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.460
and it's advisable that you do not actually just forget them.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.119
For that, actually, a very good practice that we advise is that you actually go

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.490
into the billing settings of your Amazon account very early on and you say,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.010
I want to receive billing alerts,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.989
you save that, and you go and create an alarm.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.235
For that alarm, you can say,

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:24.395
every time there is a cost increased by a certain delta, let's say,

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:27.975
one dollar, so every one dollar or every five dollars,

00:02:27.974 --> 00:02:30.549
please do an action like send me an email,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.910
and you put that alarm.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.560
That's usually a very good practice to start with.

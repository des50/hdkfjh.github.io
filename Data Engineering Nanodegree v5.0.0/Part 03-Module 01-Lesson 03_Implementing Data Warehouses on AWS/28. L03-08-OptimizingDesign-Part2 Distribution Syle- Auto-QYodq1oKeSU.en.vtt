00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Now, we understand the point of the even,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:05.910
start distribution strategy and

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.475
the all distribution strategy and how the all actually minimizes traveling.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.219
We have actually another,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.565
a third distribution style which is actually auto.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.535
An Auto actually leaves the decision to Redshift.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:24.440
So, the small enough tables are distributed with an old structure.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.155
They are replicated and actually Redshift does the heuristics into saying actually,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:37.935
if these are indeed replicatable or small enough to be replicated or broadcasts.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:42.040
Otherwise, the large table as done with even.

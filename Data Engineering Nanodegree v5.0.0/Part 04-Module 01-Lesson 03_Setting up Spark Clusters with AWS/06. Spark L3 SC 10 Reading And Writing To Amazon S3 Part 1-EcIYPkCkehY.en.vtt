00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
So now that you've got your Spark cluster up and running and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.759
you've tested that you are able to connect to it successfully,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.224
the next step would be to actually run some notebooks.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.189
So fortunately,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.195
Amazon has a number of different ways that you can connect to the cluster,

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.519
but very conveniently there's this option on

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.429
the left side of the EMR menu called "Notebooks."

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.070
When you click there, you'll be given

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.324
the option to create a notebook which will automatically

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:32.729
be connected to one of the clusters that you've spun up and stored on Amazon S3.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.664
Unfortunately what happens is,

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:36.009
it stored in such a way that,

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.369
if you ever need to delete your cluster and set up a new one,

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:44.974
the notebooks are stored separately and can be kept for later use.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:48.350
So go ahead and click, "Create notebook" and we'll go ahead and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.170
start with a very simple notebook not to actually do some analysis,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810
but just to test all of our connections.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.640
So I'll name it something very simple like,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.789
"Test EMR" and give it a similar description,

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.530
so just testing connections.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.359
Then importantly, when you choose a cluster,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.950
go ahead and choose the cluster that we made before,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.435
whatever you called it,

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:13.719
make sure that you've selected that,

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.704
and then you can use all the default options.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.959
Very importantly, make sure that you go ahead and use

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.944
the defaults role for the notebooks that has all the correct permissions to be able to

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:32.719
write and save to the right places and go ahead and leave the default location which

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.450
will automatically be created for you using

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.945
this notebook sub-directory in your S3 bucket.

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:41.629
So with all of that set,

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:45.079
just go ahead and create a notebook and within a few minutes,

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.689
you should have a notebook that you're able to open and edit live in your browser.

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.109
Let's recap what you've done so far.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.810
You've set up a Spark cluster on AWS,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.769
submitted Spark code using Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.545
and you've also used distributed data storage using both S3 and HDFS.

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:25.080
So, you now have all the tools to analyze massive datasets on a distributed system.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.019
But as you start to use these tools,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.475
you'll run into some issues,

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.234
sometimes in your code and sometimes in your data.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:36.780
Let's learn how to deal with these issues and debug our Spark jobs.

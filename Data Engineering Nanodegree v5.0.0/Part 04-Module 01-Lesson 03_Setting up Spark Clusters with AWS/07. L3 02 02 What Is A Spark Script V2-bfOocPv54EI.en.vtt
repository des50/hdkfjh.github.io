00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.304
Up until now, you've been using Jupyter notebooks to run your Python code.

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:15.269
These notebooks are great for prototyping as well as exploring and visualizing your data.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.239
If you develop an amazing data product and a notebook,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.849
you can easily share their results with your coworkers.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.335
However, Jupyter notebooks aren't the best tool for automating your workflow,

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.780
that's where Python scripts come into play.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.980
Why would you want to use Python scripts instead of sticking with Jupyter notebooks?

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.539
Well, imagine you work for

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.439
a social media company that receives a constant stream of text,

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.034
image, and video data from your users.

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:41.894
To keep up with your users,

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:45.515
you want your Spark jobs to run automatically at specific intervals,

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.524
perhaps once every hour.

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.850
These Spark jobs give your entire team

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.789
the latest information on their users and will probably

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.295
become so useful to your team that they will start to request more and more Spark jobs.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.969
You won't want to manually run a growing collection of notebooks,

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.689
you'll want automated scripts that you can set and forget.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.590
So next, you'll learn how to rework your Jupyter notebooks into

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.939
Python scripts and submit these scripts to your cluster from the command line.

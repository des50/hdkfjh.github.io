Hi. I'm Sam Helensory and I'm going to be with you for this course,

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:08.474
Introduction to Data Warehouse on Cloud.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.649
The course is composed of three lessons.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.115
In the first lesson, we will go through the basics of data warehouses,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.925
assuming really very basic knowledge.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.780
The second one, my colleague, Junali,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.230
will be introducing you to the basics of Amazon Web Services.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.339
In the third lesson,

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:33.899
we'll be combining both lessons to build a data warehouse on Amazon Web Services.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.614
I hope is going to be useful,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.060
informative, and hopefully fun.

Dicing. For the dicing here,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.690
we're having the same query again,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.940
but we're putting these three here.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:15.660
So, we're putting restrictions on the rating that's going to be PG-13 and PG,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.929
the city is going to be only those two cities,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.910
and the day is going to be at the 1st,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.605
the 15th, and the 30th.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.504
With that, we are actually having three-dimensions,

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:28.609
the three actually mean something to us,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.449
it's not a constant any longer,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.990
and we computed what's known as a sub cube.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.060
So, we actually were able to extract a smaller cube from the big cube.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.355
Slicing. The slicing is actually reducing an N dimensional cube.

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.525
Cube, as we agreed, could be actually not only three.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.570
It can be multiple dimensions if we grouped by that one.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.519
So, if we actually fixed one of the dimensions to a single value,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.780
we take a slice.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.565
So, here for example,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:29.325
if we say that we only want to reduce our scope to the onset of March,

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:32.024
so we got this slice,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:33.929
because in this slice, it's fixed.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.280
We still have the branch dimension and we still get the movie dimension,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.075
but the month's dimension is fixed to March.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.160
So, that's a slice.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.779
Then there is a dice,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.155
and when we dice an OLAP cube,

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.289
we actually have the same number of dimensions.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.104
So, if it was three-dimensional,

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:54.879
it will remain three-dimensional.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.900
However, we're going to compute a sub cube by restricting the range of values.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.894
So, for example, we are going to say,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.080
we have the movie, the month,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.250
and the branch, but the month is going to be restricted to February and March.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.629
So, it's a range of value.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:10.864
Movie is in Avatar or Batman,

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:12.594
and the branch is New York.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:17.569
So, that's a smaller sub-cube and that's a dice operation.

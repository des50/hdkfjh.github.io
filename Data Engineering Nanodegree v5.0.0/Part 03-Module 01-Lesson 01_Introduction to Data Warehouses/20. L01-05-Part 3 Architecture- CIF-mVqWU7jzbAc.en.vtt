00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Then there is another form.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.945
There's another model which is the Inmon's CIF or Corporate Information Factory.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.990
In that case, we go from the data sources,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.580
do a first ETL process,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.410
and get everything at first in a 3NF database,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.899
sometimes called the enterprise data warehouse.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.429
So, we go and say, "Hey,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.219
relax, it is normalized outside.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:25.410
We're going to get it here also normalized,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.820
we're going to do our cleaning,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.225
we're going to do our integration and then we're going to have,

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:35.880
still in an improved copy of reality with the same model.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.355
We're going to have an enterprise data warehouse.

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:40.799
So, sometimes the enterprise data warehouse just

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.869
means the normalized part in a CIF architecture.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.604
Then, from that clean one,

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.879
we're still going to do that data marts.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.100
But now that data marts are not uncoordinated because they have one baseline.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.700
So, this tries to strike a little bit balance between

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.245
independence of departments doing the data marts,

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:09.974
and not having like totally independent ETL that could lead to inconsistencies.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:12.309
You'll see that the front room,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.510
the BI application here,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.305
our dining area, it's like an open kitchen in a way.

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.590
Because the backroom starts from here

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.719
and up to there because all of this is ETL processes,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.385
that's a kitchen area where things are prepared.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:35.150
But actually the BI application have a chance to get data from the data mart,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.570
but also from the normalized enterprise data warehouse, if so desired,

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.769
the data in its original format before

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.670
the dimensional modelling is available to the BI application.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.825
So, here in CIF we have two ETL processes,

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:57.969
one that takes data from the source system to the normalized database,

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.525
and from the normalized database to the departmental data marts,

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:07.150
one is data acquisition and one is data delivery.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.379
The normalized database, which is the enterprise wide data store,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.789
is single, it's integrated and could be accessed by the end users.

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.750
And also the practice in these data marts,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.155
that unlike the Kimball dimensional models, these are aggregated.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:25.955
Why? Because we can afford it.

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:27.040
Why can we afford that?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.509
Because actually if you need something really more atomic and aggregated,

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.759
you can go back and get it from the unnormalized data store,

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:39.109
or do another aggregation for its after inspection.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.560
That would also be physical.

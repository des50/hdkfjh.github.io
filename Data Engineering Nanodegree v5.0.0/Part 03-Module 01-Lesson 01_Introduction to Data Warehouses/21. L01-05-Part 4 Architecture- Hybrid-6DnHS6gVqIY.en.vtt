00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:08.384
the Kimball model and the Inmon model in a hybrid approach,

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:11.625
and they said, this 3NF is really cool,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.310
but we're not going to do data marks.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.905
We're still going to do conformed dimensions.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:21.585
But we are also going to expose the enterprise data warehouse

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:28.030
here so that's taking a little bit the best of both worlds.

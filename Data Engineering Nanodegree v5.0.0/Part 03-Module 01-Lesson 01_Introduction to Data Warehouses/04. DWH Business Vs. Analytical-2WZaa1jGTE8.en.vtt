00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.339
If we take a business perspective,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.879
a business is in general set of business processes.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.495
What we want to do here is actually to separate

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:14.259
what's known as operational processes from analytical processes.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.210
The motto of the operational processes is "Make it work."

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.795
We need to find the goods,

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.225
we need to stock the goods,

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:25.505
we need to pick up and deliver the goods,

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:29.609
and these are operational processes

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.469
and we don't care about the reporting or analytics or anything like that.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.409
A guy sitting in front of the cashier doesn't really care about analytics,

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.500
all what he wants is to serve the customer really quickly.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.314
However, we have a different set of processes which are

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:51.774
the analytical processes and these are the motto that, "Hey, what's going on?"

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:54.299
Here we need to assess performance,

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.149
look into really a bigger scope,

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.070
really the big picture guy,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.475
not like I want to get my job done gone.

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:07.340
That's actually the business perspective.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.914
To put that more in perspective,

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:17.425
we say so what happens if we just try and get the same databases that we have.

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:21.310
These are operational databases and we say to ourselves,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.125
well, they are excellent cooperation,

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.250
there is no redundancy,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
there is high integrity and if designed properly,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.094
they are doing the job impeccably.

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:34.599
But maybe let's try them for analytics.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.359
One thing would actually work.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.579
They wouldn't say no but they wouldn't do that job really

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.899
well because this is really too slow for analytics,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.160
there are too many joints and it's too hard to understand.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.170
Why they are too hard to understand because they were modeled in

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.375
mind for these three normal form and so on from a technical perspective.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:01.599
Even if they are easy to understand,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.039
if I have to give you that,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.620
actually just having all the load on these,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.784
these are pretty hard tough workloads.

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.490
Just having both processes running on

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.840
the same databases is not going to be good to start with.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.995
The general solution is the warehouse where basically,

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:31.270
we're going to take these data sources and we're going to do something with them,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.210
transfer them to another thing and that thing should be

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.650
able to support our analytical processes well.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.254
That created actually the idea of OLAP vs OLTP,

00:02:44.254 --> 00:02:47.750
i.e online transaction processing which we already have

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.550
versus the new thing which we don't know what it is,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.219
I know you have an idea, which is actually the online analytical processing.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.150
The data warehouse is a system which includes the processes,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.760
the technologies and data representations that

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:09.099
enables us to support the analytical processes.

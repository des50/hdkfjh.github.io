00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.139
Another architecture which is actually a little bit ad

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:10.629
hoc but it happens in reality is that we get the backroom and the front room,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.575
but we have each department alone.

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.339
Each department alone would go and fetch,

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.109
have separate ETL processes.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.660
So, if we have three departments here,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.910
we're going to have three ETL processes

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.385
totally unaware of each other, totally uncoordinated.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.825
They would repeat each other's work,

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:34.405
they would model dimensions differently.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:38.274
This is totally opposite to the idea of conformed dimensions.

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:40.299
The data dimension here might be different than here,

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.189
might be different in there.

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.294
So, a data mart in principle inside,

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.105
it's also facts and dimension.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:51.619
It's a much smaller data model or dimensional data model and it's actually

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.994
focused only on one department or one business process.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.584
The independent data marts architecture.

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:04.549
The problem of it is that it can give you uncoordinated and inconsistent views.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.299
So, at the end of the day I might be summing up something in a department and

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.149
another department would be summing the same thing

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.810
and we would get different views because we already started,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.075
our cleaning process is not the same,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.600
the design of our dimensions is not the same,

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.244
the facts are not the same and so on.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.189
The thing is of course there is a little bit of

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.359
an advantage or acknowledgement of reality.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.540
That type of advantage is that, hey,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.245
every department just wants to live on its own and wants to do its own job,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:40.490
it wants its autonomy and doesn't want to coordinate with others.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:45.069
When you go into logistics of companies sometimes coordination is a huge overhead.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.159
Naturally, if you can afford and it's good to have the coordination,

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.884
but some people just say, "Okay,

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:55.130
autonomy can get things done faster even if not so consistent."

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:01.109
But in general, it is regarded as a practice which is not really encouraged.

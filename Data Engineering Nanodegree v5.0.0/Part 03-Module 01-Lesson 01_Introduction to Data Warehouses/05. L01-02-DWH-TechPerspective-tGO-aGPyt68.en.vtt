00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.780
Now that we understand the business motivation

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.119
for a data warehouse or for creating a data warehouse,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.740
let's look more at the technical perspective.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.404
There are many definitions for a data warehouse,

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.524
and let's look at some because they show us different perspectives.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:23.339
So, for example, Kimball who was one of the pioneers of the data warehouse actually says

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.300
the following very simple definition: "A data warehouse is a copy of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.605
transaction data specifically structured for query and analysis."

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.990
So, the focus here is that,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.399
we're going to take a copy,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.350
we're not going to work on the same data,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.480
and we're going to structure it in a way that is optimal for query and analysis.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.969
Let's take another definition by another pioneer of

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.795
that field who's Bill Inmon, and he says,

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.840
"A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.005
nonvolatile, and time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions."

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.440
So, we still have the management decisions in

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.929
the idea that this is a decision-making kind of a process,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.125
basically motivated by making management decisions and insights.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.855
But the idea is that it's subject-oriented,

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:19.915
and now he's getting more specific into the idea that there is no one-size-fits-all,

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.480
or you have to categorize them by topic in a way.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.880
It's integrated, which means,

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:29.359
the information you're going to get is going to come from many sources,

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.790
and it's nonvolatile in the sense that it's not transient.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.340
This has to be persistent,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.140
and it's a time-variant collection, which means,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.390
I can ask the same question today,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.150
tomorrow, and another day and it's going to change.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.224
We have another one, which is from Rainardi,

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:51.619
and by the way,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.020
I am referencing here three books,

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:59.224
and you can let look at the references at the end of the lesson.

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:00.439
But here, it says,

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.929
"A data warehouse is a system that retrieves, consolidates data periodically."

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.575
So, we have to retrieve and consolidate,

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:09.509
which we saw in the previous derilium.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.949
But here, we add periodically,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.179
in the sense giving us the knowledge that this is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.390
a continuous process from the source system into a dimensional or normalized data store,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.899
and here we start saying, "Oh,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.730
we might either get in a dimension or normalized data store.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.024
We don't know. That's a design option,

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:31.205
and then it usually keeps years of history and

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:35.965
is queried for business intelligence and other unethical activities,

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:38.270
and it's typically updated in batches.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.810
Not every time a transactions happened in the source system."

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.055
So, here we are getting a little bit more of detail

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:45.710
about the internal workings of a data warehouse,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.719
and both of them are

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:57.245
actually valid definitions which

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.620
show us different perspectives of a data warehouse.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.200
So, the idea would be as follows: a data warehouse,

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.984
the first activity in it would be to do what's known as ETL,

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:15.524
where you extract the data from the source system used for operations,

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:17.155
and you transform them,

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.310
and you load them into a dimensional model.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.789
The dimensional model itself is designed to make it easy for business users to work with

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:31.030
the data and it should improve the analytical query performance.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.405
Naturally, the technologies that is used here might be completely different.

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:37.129
Both of them are databases,

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.335
but they might not be the same type of databases that we use here.

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:46.490
Finally, we would need here also what's known

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.230
as business intelligence applications that would actually have lots of visuals,

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
and reportings, and graphs,

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.764
and things of that sort.

00:03:56.764 --> 00:04:02.104
So, to sum it up, the data warehouse goals has to be simple to understand.

00:04:02.104 --> 00:04:03.244
That's a goal on itself.

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:05.689
It should be easy to understand,

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.419
and it has to be performance,

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.519
and it has to be quality assured,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.790
and it should be able to handle new questions well and naturally it needs to be secure.

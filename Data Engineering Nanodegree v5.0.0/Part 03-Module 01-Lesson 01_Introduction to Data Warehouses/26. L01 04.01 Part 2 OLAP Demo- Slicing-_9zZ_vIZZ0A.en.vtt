00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Then, we try to slice,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.644
and if you remember slicing is that we're going to reduce the dimensionality,

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.615
and we have already three here.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:13.275
I want to make sure also you're not confused and thinking that this

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.129
is a dimension because this is actually the fact.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:22.664
So, this is the cube and this would be the content of each cell in the cube, okay?

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.049
These are 3-dimensions, that's the fact.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.250
So we slice, when we slice,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960
we are going actually to say where the movie rating is equal to PG-13.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.314
When we have that, we fixed that,

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.934
so we still have three column,

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.980
but we're not counting this one because this one

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.549
became now only slicing for us, that cube.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.239
So actually the actual relation we have now is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.200
between the day and the city giving that the rating is constant.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.060
So that's a slice.

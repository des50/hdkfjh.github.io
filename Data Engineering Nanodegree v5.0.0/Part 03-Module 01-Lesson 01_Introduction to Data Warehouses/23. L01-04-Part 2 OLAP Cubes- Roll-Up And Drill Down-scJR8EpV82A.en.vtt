00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
Rolling up is actually going through one dimension like for example,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.245
the branch and instead of having here the cities,

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:13.979
we're going to group all the US Cities and sum them,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.620
and all the French cities and sum them.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.905
With that, we have rolled up,

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:24.630
we say that we have rolled up the branch dimension.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.644
Similarly, we can also drill down,

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:32.609
which means we're going to take each city and decompose it,

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.454
let's say to districts.

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:38.609
With rolling up actually, the dimension actually,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.500
you get fewer values here,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.045
and was drilling down you get more values.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.765
That's why the OLAP cube should store the finest grain of data,

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:52.200
sometimes called atomic data,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.315
in case we need to drill down to the lowest level.

00:00:55.314 --> 00:01:00.349
For example, country and then city and then district and then street.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.880
In our OLAP cubes,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.600
we choose the city as our grain of the dimension.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.640
But then we can go into a more coarse screen or we

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.629
can go into a more fine grain or even finer grain.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.949
At one in time are going to say,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.250
for example, that we will not go beyond street.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.819
So, that would be the atomic data on the finest grain.

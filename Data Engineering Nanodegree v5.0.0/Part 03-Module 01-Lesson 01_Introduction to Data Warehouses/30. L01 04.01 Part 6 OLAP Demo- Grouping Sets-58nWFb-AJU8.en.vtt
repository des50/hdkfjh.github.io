00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
We have something called the group sets,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:07.905
and the grouping set is something which is actually rather nice.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.455
Because we can say let's group by nothing,

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:13.214
group by the first dimension, second dimension,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:15.390
third dimension, first and second,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.100
second and third, first and third,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.410
first and second, and so forth.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.504
For example, here we're going to group by nothing,

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:25.169
select all the revenue.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.940
So that's grouping by nothing.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.000
Here, grouping revenue by country.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.695
So let's group by country.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.929
Here, let's grouped by month.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.984
So we're seeing each month revenue.

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:39.079
Then we take the combination month and country and so forth.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.489
Then we take month by country and months and an all in one shot.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.929
So what regrouping set is going to do for us,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.019
is we are going to actually explicitly say,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.020
please instead of saying group by something or a number of columns,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.545
we're going to say group by grouping sets.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:07.555
My desired grouping sets are actually nothing,

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:11.460
the month alone, the country alone,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.774
the dimension, and the country.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:21.155
Here actually, I chose to make a small cube of two-dimensions,

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:27.064
just so we don't get overwhelmed by the dimensions.

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:29.855
So here we have only two dimensions,

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.895
which is the month and the country.

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:35.575
However, one time we're not doing any grouping,

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:38.335
one time we're doing grouping by one-dimension,

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:41.304
another time by the other dimension,

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:44.780
and a third time by the combination of both dimensions here.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.575
Look how the output looks like now.

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:54.210
So this is a grouping by month and country for the month one.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.369
Look, there is a none here,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.125
and that none is actually an expressive none which says that irrespective of the country,

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:05.564
here is the revenue.

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:09.425
So, this is a grouping by month only.

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:14.390
But it works as a subtotal for these two lines.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.144
Then you go likewise here,

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:18.480
and none likewise here,

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.649
and none likewise here,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.620
and none, and so forth.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.784
Then we actually get another thing.

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:30.020
We get none-none and a total revenue and that is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.270
actually the total revenue we have computed here.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.930
These were like 67,000, the total revenue.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.474
So when we get none and none here,

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:44.614
that was the grouping by nothing.

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:52.115
Then we also get the whole amount for Canada and the whole amount for Australia.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.189
So in one goal,

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.250
we pass through this once,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.664
and we get all these combinations of sub-grouping.

00:03:00.664 --> 00:03:02.469
Of course, if we had three dimensions,

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.319
we'd have found many more combinations.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:15.649
So otherwise, we would have needed to go one, two,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.400
three, four times, four passes through the facts table to compute this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Actually, we might want to also do the reverse like drill down,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.734
so going from the city level to the district level.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:12.434
In that case also,

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.835
the drilling down was taken care of by the design.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:16.259
So from the city,

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.945
we can roll up to a country and we can drill down to a district.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:26.280
Okay. Now, I'm going to move to something completely different,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.995
which is optimizing the query time.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.644
So the idea is as follows.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:33.359
We are going to slice, dice,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.100
roll up all the time and each time we do something of these up there,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.070
we go through the whole facts table.

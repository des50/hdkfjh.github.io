00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
Then, we have a roll-up operation.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.980
In the roll-up operation actually,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.355
remember that we were working on the day level, right?

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:11.890
So we want to go and work,

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.355
sorry, we are going to roll up on the country, from city to country.

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:20.074
So here we had the city.

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:24.975
So changing that the customer country from city to country,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.280
we actually went in,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:35.945
we are going to have less rows or less unique number of dimensions in the country.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:45.320
So we actually have rolled up the branch because this is the, sorry the customer.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.094
Because we are displaying the customer country or the customer city.

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:55.369
So originally we were showing the customers city and now all Lancaster

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:01.000
and all other cities of the country are going to be rolled up together.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.674
Simply by because we actually had them here.

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:09.634
Now, what would happen if the table was purely designs?

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:15.185
We might have needed actually to go and doing this summation ourselves.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.454
But because this was actually reflected in the design,

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:20.390
we didn't need to do that.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.489
That's why while designing,

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:27.149
one should have these ideas in mind.

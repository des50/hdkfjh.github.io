00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
I know that this part actually from

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.960
the slides might be conceptually clear

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.304
but you will need to actually try this on some SQL code.

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:13.320
So, let's go through our demo,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.460
and what we will do here,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.820
we're still going to use the Sakila database or

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
the Postgres version of it which is famous for being called [inaudible].

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.230
We're going to walk through the facts and dimensions.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.410
We're going to create the OLAP cube from the facts and dimensions using Group by,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we're going to slice,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.320
dice, roll up, and drill down.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.670
That would be the old fashion.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.539
Then, we're going to redo the exercise using the Group by cube.

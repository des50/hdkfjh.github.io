00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.769
Hi. Welcome to the introduction to the data warehouses course.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.509
In this course we will be learning about data warehouses,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.730
their purpose, different architectures,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.480
and technologies used to build data warehouses.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.355
The prerequisites for this course are as follows,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.990
you need to have a basic knowledge of

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.179
relational database design and the SQL query language,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
and then you need to know a little bit of Python,

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:35.549
because we're using that in Jupiter Notebooks,

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.209
and basic familiarity with dimensional modeling and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.039
we are reiterating a number of examples here.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.435
So, this is the plan of our lesson here.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:50.900
The first thing we will do is that we'll looking at data warehouses from

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.939
a business perspective and then from a technical perspective.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.644
Then we're going to take a look at the dimensional modeling.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:02.250
Then we will see different architectures and then we'll talk about OLAP cubes,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.099
and finally we'll look at the storage technologies.

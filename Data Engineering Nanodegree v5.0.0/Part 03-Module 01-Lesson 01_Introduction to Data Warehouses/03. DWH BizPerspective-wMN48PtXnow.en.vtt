00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
So from a business perspective,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
the warehouse in a business context is as follows.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.429
Put yourself in this mental mode where you are

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.504
in charge of our retailer's data infrastructure.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:18.660
So let's look at some business activities that happen in that retailer's IT department,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.605
or I mean business in general not even IT department.

00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:25.625
So the customers should be able to find goods and make orders.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.609
The inventory staff should be able to stock,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.394
retrieve, and reorder goods.

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:36.274
The delivery staff need to easily be able to pick up and deliver the goods.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:41.539
Then the HR department should be able to assess the performance of the sales staff and

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.609
the marketing department needs to see whether

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.109
the different sales channels are performing well or not and how do they compare.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.564
The management should be able to monitor the sales growth.

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:57.094
So with your SQL knowledge and database design knowledge,

00:00:57.094 --> 00:01:01.589
ask yourself, can I build a database to support these activities?

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.724
Well, I believe if you had a decent course in database design,

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.914
the answer should be yes.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.455
Another question would be,

00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:18.245
are all of the above questions of the same nature?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.930
Well, yeah some of them look maybe you already guessed,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.800
but let's look closer to to be able to give a more educated answer.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.674
But before doing that,

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:35.269
you get a little bit more of details about the business.

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:37.700
The retailer for example,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.715
has a nation-wide presence.

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:44.299
So for example, you know how to handle the scale of the database?

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.034
Like nation-wide database?

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.409
Well, perhaps you're going to do a central one,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.780
perhaps you're going to do many databases for

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.049
different stores and headquarters and so forth.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.394
Then you would learn that the retailer acquired other smaller retailers.

00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:11.044
Some of them are brick and mortar and some of them are like an online store.

00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:14.629
So you will see that things are a little bit complex.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.294
Not that I mean,

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:21.719
it's not about base design any longer that we have many systems now to integrate.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.540
Then you would learn that the business

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.530
also has like a call center and social media accounts,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.050
and you wants to actually put that in the database when reporting about like how people

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.890
feel about the different products or service and so on.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:51.484
Then you will see that you can have like sales staff expect to see a performance results

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:55.760
and the customer and inventory staff

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.000
expect to see a system that is fast and stable while operating.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.814
I mean, whenever someone looks up a customer or tries to

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:08.060
deliver a good or look up an SQL in the store,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.189
in the inventory, it should be quick.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.829
Similarly, the HR and marketing department also want

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.160
to have a lot of information but haven't decided yet on everything they need.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.615
So the requirements are not very clear.

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:25.969
We know that they're going to evolve.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.099
So perhaps maybe a single relational database won't suffice.

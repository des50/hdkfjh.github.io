00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
OLAP cubes.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.165
Once we are done building our facts and dimension tables,

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:09.099
we are now in a position to start querying,

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.414
and exploring, and getting insights.

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:15.959
The typical way of doing this is that we take a combination of dimensions like,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.000
for example, the movie itself,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.074
the movie title, and the branch store or the city where the branch is located,

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:26.714
and we sum up the sales.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.570
So, this is actually a fact metric dimension,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.119
another dimension, and we have also here a third dimension, which is the month.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:40.664
So, you can see that these are the three dimensions of the cube.

00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.509
Naturally, a cube can have more dimensions if

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.564
we grouped the data by more dimensions, if you so wish.

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.369
The nice thing about that,

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.919
that this is a model which is easy communicate the bill to business users.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.990
Once we have this abstraction in mind, users usually,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.260
who are trained in dealing with those OLAP cubes,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200
would think in terms of rolling up,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.379
drilling down, slicing, and dicing those OLAP cubes.

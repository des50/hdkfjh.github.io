00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.174
Okay. So we got the gross topping or at the top grossing films.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:09.599
We can perhaps also see w here customers are coming from

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.559
and from which city our customers buy more.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.719
So these are the top grossing customer cities.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.164
Again, also to to do that similarly,

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:29.689
you have to go from the payment to the customer,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.310
to the address, to the city.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.420
So you also have to do that join which is cumbersome.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.550
Well, the idea is when you have a huge schema and you have lots of links to follow,

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.829
that becomes really hard to follow.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.494
So we do not want our business users to start thinking this way.

00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:55.429
Similar to the movies,

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.090
we also will compute the top grossing cities this way.

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.629
So, now that we know that we are going to

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.160
store our tables after ETL into a dimensional model,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.300
let's take a recap about dimension modeling.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.640
So, we know that the third normal form databases are

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.635
actually optimized for consistency and deduplication,

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:28.440
and it might be hard to explain to business users,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.960
and shall we do the queries from a schema like that,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.844
we would actually incur lots of expensive joins.

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:39.250
While, actually what we want to do is to work with

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.814
star schemas which have been covered briefly in the previous course.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:49.784
But what we need to do is,

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:59.339
what we need to know is that they good for OLAP and not for OLTP.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.460
So, we know that we have fact tables and they

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.950
record business events like an order, a phone call,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.350
a book review, and that fact table columns

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:10.084
record events recorded in quantifiable metrics.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.304
So, like quantity of an item,

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.595
duration of a call,

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.325
a book rating, and so forth.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:21.344
Dimensional table, they record the context of a business like who, what, where,

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:26.655
and the columns of them are called attributes,

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:28.939
like the store at which an item is purchased

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.599
or the customer who made the call or so forth.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:36.414
Sometimes it's not very clear what's a fact and what's a dimension,

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:38.990
I would say we should look at the facts first.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.329
So, if you're not sure,

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.314
a fact column is always going to be numeric and additive in 99 percent of the cases.

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:50.625
For example, a comment on an article,

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:53.909
someone commented on an article, is actually an event.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.979
One might think that this is a fact that should be recorded,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.424
while it is actually,

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:02.730
but the thing is without

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.814
really strong NLP skills or a little bit of sentiment analysis or something like that,

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:12.155
you will not be able to just add,

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:13.819
maybe you add the number of comments.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.159
The number of comments itself might be a fact,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.340
but just getting the text and making sense out of it is not that simple,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.015
so that's not a good fact.

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.769
The invoice number is numeric,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.219
but I will not going to add the invoice numbers together.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:34.819
The total amount paid in an invoice and the number of items in that invoice,

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
these could be added to compute total sales,

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.259
and that's actually a good fact.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.500
So, numeric and additive is your litmus test for

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.360
knowing whether a particular column should be in the fact table or not.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.055
Then you have the dimensions,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:57.030
and the tricks are date and time are always a dimension,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.509
physical locations like stores and so forth,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.835
and addressees and things alike,

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:09.599
are good candidates for dimensions.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.989
Human roles, whether someone is a customer or

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.080
staff or a teacher or student or something like this.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.500
Goods sold or courses taught or something of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.870
that sort also is a good candidate for dimension.

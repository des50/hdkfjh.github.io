00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Now, instead of this complicated setup,

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:09.580
let's go and create some facts on dimension tables.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.510
Now, here again, I'm going to try to open this image in a new tab,

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.490
take this URL and put it perhaps here.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.750
This is our target schema.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.684
If we start looking here,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:33.359
initially in our initial schema,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.740
we have no table called date.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.230
But because of the idea that we need actually

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.769
to get dimensions and use them actually in a number of facts,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.430
we're going to extract a date dimension on its own.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.780
Let's see what the changes are going to be here.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.109
So, we're going to create a table called dimension dates,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.214
and then we're going to make a date key.

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:02.870
That one actually the date key could be just an auto-increment number

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.009
or serial like we're doing here for the customer table.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.325
But for clarity, actually,

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:14.075
all dimensional schema suggested to make it an

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:20.909
integer that actually looked like a date.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.340
But for simplicity, just consider that this could be a normal key like auto-increment.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.469
Then we have the data itself untouched.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.929
Then we have the year alone,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.750
the quarter alone, Q1, Q2, Q3,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.870
Q4, we have the months, we have the day,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.555
possibly from 1-30 or 31st,

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:44.220
then we have the week,

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.969
until week 1-52, and then we have something called is_weekend.

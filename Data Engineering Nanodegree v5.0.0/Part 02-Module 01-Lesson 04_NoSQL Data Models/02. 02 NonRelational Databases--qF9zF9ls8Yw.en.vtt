00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.084
So, let's just go through some terminology.

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:06.089
NoSQL and non-relational are interchangeable terms.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.960
So, NoSQL equals not only SQL.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.460
For the rest of this lesson,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.060
I'll refer to non-relational databases as NoSQL databases.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.295
Historically, this did stand for non-SQL or NoSQL.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.990
But as we learned in lesson one,

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.484
NoSQL has come to mean not only SQL.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:31.725
As languages like Cassandra query language closely mimics SQL and they're very close.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:37.070
So, let's just do a quick refresher on when to use a NoSQL database.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.500
So, if you need high availability,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.899
you have large amounts of data.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.524
You need linear scalability.

00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:46.475
You need low latency,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:48.410
you need fast reads and writes.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.474
For example; if you are going to be using Apache Cassandra,

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:57.335
that's a good example of when you would use a NoSQL database is to use Apache Cassandra.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.219
So, let's talk a little bit about what Apache Cassandra actually is.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.920
So, it's an open source NoSQL database.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.049
You can go download the code right now.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.625
It's all open source and you can go download it, check it out.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:14.015
Run it. Whatever you want do contribute to it. We would all love that.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:17.989
It has a masterless architecture and it has high availability.

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:19.869
It's linearly scalable.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.050
So, like I said Apache Cassandra is an open-source technology that was created

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.399
at Facebook and became a top-level Apache project in 2010.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.975
It was created to handle

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:34.069
big data challenges that relational databases were failing to meet.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.009
It's a masterless architecture with no single point of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.995
failure which makes it highly available.

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.820
It has low latency for reads and writes and it's linear scalable.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.439
You add more nodes to just a quick note on when I use the term nodes,

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.424
we use that a lot in the distributed database world.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.239
But it's really a server.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.584
It can mean server or VM or it's just a system.

00:01:56.584 --> 00:02:00.259
One single entity of that system whatever that a Docker container,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.100
whatever that system is that's what it means.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.919
So, when we say nodes that's what we're referring to.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.629
So, as you add more nodes to the system,

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.275
your performance will actually increase

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:12.245
linearly when you're thinking about linear scalability.

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:16.765
Apache Cassandra is used at the backend for some of those most popular apps.

00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:19.104
Basically, if you take a look at your phone,

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.069
some of the apps that you use every day,

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.884
Apache Cassandra is the backend.

00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:27.864
So, very popular apps that use Apache Cassandra are Uber,

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:30.365
Netflix, Hulu, and Twitter.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.680
Those are just a few. Another example is Apple.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.795
Apple has over a 7,000 node deployment of Apache Cassandra.

00:02:38.794 --> 00:02:41.799
Companies like DataStax, Apple,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.365
Twitter and Facebook are all major contributors to the project.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.300
Remember with an open-source project,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.600
anyone is free to contribute.

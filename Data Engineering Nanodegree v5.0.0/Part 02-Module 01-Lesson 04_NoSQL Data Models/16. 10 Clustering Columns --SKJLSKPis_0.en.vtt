00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Now let's move on to clustering columns.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:05.744
Clustering columns- The PRIMARY KEY is made up of

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:09.884
either just the PARTITION KEY or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:15.554
The CLUSTERING COLUMNS will determine the sort order within a Partition.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:20.295
The clustering columns will sort the data in sorted descending order.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:25.845
More than one clustering column can be added or like we talked about before, or none.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.404
So, in this case,

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:32.730
we have a Composite key with it we're partitioning by year,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.569
and then from there we have a clustering column on artist's name, and album name.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.965
So, you can see here in this example if I did a select star from that music library,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.600
you can see that I have my year,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.590
and then my artist's name which is then in alphabetical order in descending order;

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.750
E comes before T,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.125
and B comes before M. Then after that,

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.899
it's going to sort by album name.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.394
So, here you can see again so,

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.345
Elvis so Blue Hawaii,

00:01:00.344 --> 00:01:02.524
and then we're going to sort the Beatles.

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:04.280
Here we're going to have Rubber Soul,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.180
and then here I just wanted to make sure it was something that came after Rubber Soul,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.630
so I made it not really an album it's called, 'Showing the order'.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:15.030
So, here it's going to be in descending order as you can see.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.299
Then here we'll have the item for the Monkees.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.484
From there, the clustering column will sort in sorted order,

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:22.944
and how they were added to the primary key.

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:25.984
So, for example, in this example that I just showed,

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:28.174
they will be distributed by the key,

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:32.954
then sorted in descending order by first the artist's name, and then the album name.

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:38.120
So, the primary key is made up of a partition key which in this case is year,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.060
and a clustering column which is the artist's name.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.064
Remember this is just an example.

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:47.465
It might not be unique enough of a value.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.480
Let's say that the artist created two albums in one year.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.340
Then this data model would not hold up.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.170
But just for the sake of this demo,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.864
we're going to assume that it's unique.

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:59.534
So, here we're going to clustering or excuse me,

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:01.825
our partition key here which is year,

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.480
and our clustering column artist's name.

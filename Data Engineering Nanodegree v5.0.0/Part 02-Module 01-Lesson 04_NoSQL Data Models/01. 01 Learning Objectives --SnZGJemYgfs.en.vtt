00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
So, welcome to lesson three,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.054
Data Modeling for Non-relational Databases.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:08.160
The learning objectives for this lesson are: students will learn

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.564
the fundamentals of data modeling for NoSQL databases,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:14.969
focusing on the basics of NoSQL database design,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.385
denormalization, primary keys, clustering columns and the WHERE clause.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.280
This is one of my favorite topics.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.070
It's a little bit complicated but it's very rewarding once you have

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.969
a full understanding of how to do data modeling for NoSQL databases.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.589
So, let's get started.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.539
It's going to be a little complicated but it's going to be fun.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
So just a quick word on CQL.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.730
Cassandra Query Language is the way that we interact with the database.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.955
It's very similar to SQL, except again,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:13.425
no JOIN no GROUP BY and there's not any subqueries,

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:18.615
and they're not in CQL and they're not supported by CQL.

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:23.239
In prior years, authentic Cassandra tables were assessed using a protocol called Thrift.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.229
But that was very difficult to use and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.080
hard for users coming from the relational CQL world.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.359
There are many language drivers,

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.769
majority supported by datastacks to integrate into an application.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.640
You've seen in lesson one in our demos and the exercises,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.855
we were we're utilizing the Python driver.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:44.640
Other popular drivers are Java,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.884
C sharp, NodeJS, etc.

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:48.229
There's many many out there,

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.909
and again, they're all open source.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.569
So if you have an idea for a new one, submit the code.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.780
Go for it, go develop it.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.060
We'll continue to use the Python driver in the next set of demos and exercises.

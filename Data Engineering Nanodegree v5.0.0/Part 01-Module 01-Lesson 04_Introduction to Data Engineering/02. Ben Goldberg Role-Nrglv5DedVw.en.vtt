00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Hi, my name is Ben Goldberg.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:03.570
I'm at a company called Spot Hero,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.619
Web and Data engineer.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.629
So at Spot Hero,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
we have our data teams structured such that all the teams

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.954
outside of the data engineering team can interact with us and tell us the insights,

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.699
and information they might need us to produce.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.445
Specifically we have a group of data scientists,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.080
we have business analysts,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.794
and then we have other C-level executives

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.030
who might want to know the performance of the business.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.189
So, they all have very different needs

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.054
and different types of information that we need to provide for them.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:38.850
So, what we do is we have a data product manager,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.770
and a data engineering manager,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.430
and the two of them work together to interface with

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.020
the other aspects of the business to get

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.480
that information down to the data engineering team.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.289
Then, given that the data engineering team typically works

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.284
together as one unit to try and work through a big project at a time.

00:00:56.284 --> 00:00:58.609
We tend to prefer to work as

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.429
one cohesive team rather than as individuals a little tasks here and there.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.430
So, as a data engineer,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.050
a typical day for me tends to be coming into

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.049
work and taking a look first by opening up Airflow,

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.924
and just seeing the status of all the pipelines that we've configured.

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:19.909
Most important part of that is to make sure that everything is running as expected.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.629
Also typically have a look at our metrics, check my email,

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:26.464
and make sure that essentially nothing has failed in a way that I wouldn't expect.

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:28.325
Typically this is overboard,

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:30.635
because we do have alerts and things like that.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.590
Then I tend to write a lot of code from there.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.710
So, either I'll be building a data pipeline and something like airflow,

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.109
or we might be working with a system like Presto or

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.415
Spark to run some big query that we're trying to design.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:46.745
But the gist of it is most of my day is spent actually writing code.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:51.530
I think my favorite thing about my job is the fact that as a data engineer,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.504
I get to work with a lot of different people throughout my day-to-day.

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:56.509
So, that'll lead to I get to work with some of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.105
the most exciting tools in engineering today.

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:04.060
So, tools like Spark or Apache airflow, things like that,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.250
but I also get to actually use those tools to produce something that's

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.520
really meaningful for the people that I work with on a day-to-day basis.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.770
Whether it's a data scientist,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.805
or a data analyst,

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:17.990
or someone in the business who really needs some information.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.395
A lot of my job is making something that we can

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:25.120
basically answer question we couldn't answer 6 months or a year ago,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.480
or making a question that we could only answer every week or month.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.750
We will answer that question every minute of every day,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.090
or anytime somebody opens up a dashboard.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.310
Those are the things that are really exciting.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.319
It feels like we're actually moving forward what we're capable of as a company,

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.900
and you get to really see how exciting this is for people.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.480
So, that's definitely one of my favorite things,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.449
I think as a data engineer that I really get to enjoy.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.259
So I think one of the things that's difficult about being a data engineer is

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.139
that you're going to be working with a lot of different data sources,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.789
in a lot of different forms and inequality.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:09.879
So, we have data at Spot Hero going back years in many cases,

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.215
and some of the original data from when we were just a brand new little it bitty startup,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.680
it doesn't really work well in 2018,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.379
2019 so on and so forth because we've learned

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.009
a lot about how to actually store and structure our data for processing.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.259
So, for me, one of the things that's most

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:31.655
difficult is figuring out how to get all of this data to work together,

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:35.550
so that our pipelines run reliably and actually produce meaningful insights.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.560
That can be really difficult in terms of a challenge that I encounter.

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:46.429
So my advice for aspiring data engineers is try not to get too lost

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.050
in the soup of acronyms and tools that exist in the data engineering space.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.830
I think that a lot of people when they first learn about data engineering,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.560
they run into this wall of tools and products they

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.515
can use to solve data engineering problems.

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:04.219
My recommendation would be to focus on a couple of the big names in this space.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:10.074
So, learning how to use Airflow, Redshifts, Spark, Presto,

00:04:10.074 --> 00:04:13.579
those tools is going to be more of a benefit that to you,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.879
than to try to learn 10, 15, 20 things.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.529
Data engineering stacks aren't necessarily standardized across the entire industry.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.529
So, something that I think is really important is to hone in and

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.764
develop skills that work across the board,

00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:31.774
but not to be having a little bit of expertise,

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:36.078
and a bunch of tools is not as good as having a lot of expertise,

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:38.240
and a couple of really big important tools.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.295
You'll want to make sure that you cover your bases.

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:42.640
How am I going to organize my data pipelines?

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.219
How am I going to run big analyses that work on a lot of data?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.020
Those are the things that I would like to emphasize that when you're starting out,

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:55.859
try to figure out tools that are going to benefit you and keep it limited.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.844
So, as a data engineer,

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:02.030
some of the soft skills that are most important,

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.599
are figuring out how to work with your data consumers,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.415
to actually figure out what the requirements of what you're producing are.

00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:13.035
So, one of the first things you'll notice is that people might ask you,

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:16.550
they'll just say I need data that tells me x or y,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.770
and that doesn't really describe to you as

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.560
a data engineer exactly what you need to build.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.290
So, it's your responsibility to talk to them,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.569
human to human, and talking to somebody

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.805
who really may not have a lot of technical skills,

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:35.165
and really dig into and understand and empathize why they need the data,

00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:37.160
how important it is to them,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.760
and figure out how to come up with the solution.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.779
Not only is that an important soft skill,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.059
I think it's actually one of the best parts of this job

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.699
is that you get to work with people from all over their organization,

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.144
or even externally to your organization,

00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:52.444
and get to explain these really interesting concepts to them.

00:05:52.444 --> 00:05:56.000
Also, try to map concepts to them that might be

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.259
simple into what might be more complicated on the data engineering side.

Hi there. I'm Amanda.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm a Developer Advocate for DataStax.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.555
I got my master's in 2012 in computer science.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:09.960
Ever since then, I've been working on distributed databases.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.790
Now finally, I've landed at DataStax,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.490
which is a distributed database all around Apache Cassandra.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.490
So I became a developer advocate after working

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.680
as a software engineer for about six years.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.245
But honestly, I was always doing that work.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.285
I was always that middle layer between

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.405
engineering where I worked and our customers and our users.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.375
Not to mention, I always did lots of demos.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.690
I was always actually using our product,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.520
not just helping to develop the product,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.790
but actually using it as well,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.470
and then helping our customers utilize it and use it.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.295
That was always really rewarding to me.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.905
I love doing that. I love getting that feedback

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:49.580
from our customers on our product so that I could actually send that back

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.120
to engineering so that everyone's working on a product that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.970
really helps our customers and our engineers are working on something that matters.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.200
So I love doing that and I always was.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.095
Now I'm finally at a place where I can do that full time, and that's my whole job.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.910
No, I do still code,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.305
but not as much as I used to.

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:14.600
My advice for data engineers is to learn as much as you can about a variety of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.610
technologies because you never know that

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.890
what you're going to encounter once you actually get on the job.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.165
I would also say,

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:21.905
don't be afraid to just jump in.

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.845
Try something new. Volunteer at your company.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.930
If someone's doing a new type of project that maybe's

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620
not in your realm of responsibility,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.425
raise your hand, say, "Hey,

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.390
I can help out a couple hours a week."

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.990
Something like that. Don't be afraid to just jump into

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.155
a new project even if you don't have all your skills yet,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:43.140
that's a great way to own them, is just jumping in and learn fast.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.685
Welcome to the data engineering Nanodegree program.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.160
I'm Sam, and I'm a product leader Udacity.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.560
I work with a great team of industry experts and

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.035
curriculum designers to put this program together.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.884
I'm very excited to have you join us.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.105
So why data engineering?

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:18.149
Data engineering plays a vital role in storing,

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.369
organizing and making use of data.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.164
The speed and volume of information we generate everyday is incredible.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:25.589
Every-time you open your phone,

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.725
click an app, or make a purchase, you're creating data.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.535
Many of the products we use on a daily basis are powered by this data.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.519
Companies across industries are scrambling to reinvent

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.850
themselves in order to use data to better serve the customers,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.350
build better products, and even make the world a better place.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.094
Data engineers are crucial to this effort.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.945
The pipelines they build and databases they design

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.630
are the foundation that all other analytics,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.844
data science and artificial intelligence efforts are built on.

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:55.560
Without this important work,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.905
data simply sits in a data center and takes up space.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.100
Having strong data engineers is one of

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.364
the first and most important steps in the digital transformation process.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.909
When working with big data,

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.719
there are dozens of tools to choose from,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.429
and it can get confusing fast.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.550
This program will help you understand the big data ecosystem,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.459
and build your fluency in a modern set of tools.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.129
The curriculum was designed with input from

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.079
several expert data engineers from some of

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.094
the most advanced data-driven companies in the world.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:27.620
Each of the instructors has extensive experience in this field.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.170
As a result, the skills you learn are directly

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.260
applicable to what data engineers do on the job.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.765
During the program, you'll learn to model data,

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.519
build production ready data warehouses,

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.039
and data lakes, process massive amounts of data

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.955
using modern tools and automate data pipelines.

00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:46.670
Along the way, you'll build a set of projects with guidance from mentors.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.765
These projects are designed to imitate what you do on the job as a data engineer.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:53.060
Every project you submit gets reviewed,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.189
and our project viewers will provide

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.054
personalized feedback on how you can improve your work.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:02.345
These projects will serve as a portfolio you can use to demonstrate your skills.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.325
After completing the program,

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.040
you'll be prepared to land a job as a data engineer,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.500
or bring these crucial skills to your current role.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.740
We're excited and honored that you are taking this step in your journey with us.

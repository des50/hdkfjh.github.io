So let's wrap up what we learned.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.055
We learned about what is data modeling,

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.200
who does data modeling,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
when to and not to use relational databases,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.895
when to and not to use NoSQL databases,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.655
how to create a simple table and PostgreSQL,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.850
and how to create a simple table in Apache Cassandra.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.455
Lesson two we'll focus more on how to do data modeling with PostgreSQL.

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:30.490
Lesson three we'll focus more on how to do data modeling in Apache Cassandra.

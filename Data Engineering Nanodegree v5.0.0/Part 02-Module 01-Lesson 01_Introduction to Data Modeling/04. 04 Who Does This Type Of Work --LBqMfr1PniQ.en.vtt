00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
We've talked about the what and the why,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.220
and now let's talk about the who,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.975
and I don't mean the band.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.850
Who does data modeling?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.145
Data modeling is an important skill.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:13.065
It's important for data scientists,

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:15.675
software engineers, data engineers.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.635
Anyone involved in the process of using and analyzing data.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.170
So really, everyone.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.405
If you'll be working with data,

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.480
you want to have the fundamental of data modeling in your toolkit.

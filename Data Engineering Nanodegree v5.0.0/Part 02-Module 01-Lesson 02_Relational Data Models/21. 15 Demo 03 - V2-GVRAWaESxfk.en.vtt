00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
So now, we're going to move on to demo three,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.154
Creating Fact and Dimension Tables.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:08.054
So from here, I am going back to Jupiter Notebooks.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:11.564
I'm going to open lesson two, demo three,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.649
Creating Fact and Dimension Tables with a Star Schema. Just as a note.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.179
Here, we're utilizing Jupiter Notebooks and Python to interact with the database,

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.414
but this is really just one way.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:27.000
I wouldn't even say it's the best way or there's no best ways,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.204
really whatever works for your use case.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:30.419
It's all about that.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420
But this is just one way and a good way,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.240
but it's just one way that we can represent how to

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.329
connect to the database and how to do create tables,

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.695
inserts, things like that.

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:43.130
In this demo, we're going to walk through the basics of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.695
modeling data using fact and dimension tables.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.869
We'll create both fact and dimension tables,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:51.199
and show how this is the basic elements of the star schema.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.435
So again, we're going to import the library,

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:57.905
ignore my error, we're going to create a connection to the database.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:03.454
Again, this is all things that we've done in the other demos and other exercises.

00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:06.274
We're going to use that cursor to execute queries.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:09.085
Again, we're going to set our augment to true.

00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:12.515
So now, let's imagine we work in an online music store.

00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:14.870
There will be many tables in our database,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.175
but let's just focus on four of those tables all around customer purchases.

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.450
So we're going to have a table name,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.299
customer transactions, with a Customer ID,

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.700
Store ID, and how much they spent.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.755
From there, we're going to have a Customer table,

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:30.893
with a Customer ID, Name,

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:33.190
and whether they are in a rewards program.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.084
Then, we're going to have a Store table,

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.399
with Store ID, and the state that that stores in.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.844
Then, we're going to have items purchased.

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:43.219
We're going to have our Customer ID, and the Item name.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.140
So here's example.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.215
We saw this in earlier in the slides.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.325
Here are all the tables and their connections.

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:55.844
As we can see, it may be resembling the star schema here.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.980
So from this representation,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.924
we can already start to see that its the makings of the star schema.

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:03.164
We have one fact table,

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.025
the center of the star,

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.535
and three dimension tables that are coming from it.

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:09.224
So let's create the fact table,

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:10.849
insert data into the table.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.344
So we're going to create our customer transactions table,

00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:16.969
and we're going to insert the data into that table.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.055
Now, let's create a dimension tables,

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.944
insert data into those tables.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:22.775
So again, items purchased,

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.215
then we're going to insert our data.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:25.580
We're going to create our store,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.185
and insert our data into that.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.860
We're going to create our customer,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.905
and insert our data into that.

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:33.245
Let's just do that simply here.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:36.950
Alright. We can do a variety of queries

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.060
to state it easily because we are utilizing the fact,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.819
dimension, and star schema.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.509
So here's my first query I want to be able to perform.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.304
Find all the customers that spent more than $30,

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:50.915
who they are, what did they buy,

00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:52.849
and if they are rewards member.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.884
Then query two, how much did store one sell?

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:02.429
Query one, find all the customers that spent more than $30,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.560
who they are, what did they buy,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.074
and if there rewards member.

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:08.084
So for this example,

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.784
we want select on our name,

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:12.599
our item name, right?

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.014
Because we want to know who they are.

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:15.814
So that's her name. What did they buy?

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.379
The item name, and if they were rewards member or not.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.504
So if they have the rewards program.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:23.329
So to be able to do this,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.480
we're going to have to do joins on multiple of our tables.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.879
So from our customer transaction table,

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.419
we want to join on the customer table.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.969
So on, and we're going to join that on the same column,

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.370
which is Customer ID.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.250
That's our foreign key. That's how we're going to combine those two tables.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.835
From there, we want to join on the items purchased.

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:47.045
We're going to join that on the customer transaction table,

00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:50.084
that has the Customer ID and the items purchased,

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:53.295
which also has a column called Customer ID.

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:59.399
All of this, we only want the customers or they spent more than $30.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.194
So it looks like two b,

00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:05.389
somebody who spent more than $30 on let it be,

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.919
and he is not a rewards member.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.939
Now, we want to do a second query.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.745
How much did store one sell?

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.610
So third query, we want to do a select Store ID,

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.905
because we want it from store one.

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:23.699
Then, we want to do a sum on the spent column,

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.649
from customer transactions, GroupBy Store ID.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:31.379
Great. So we see store one,

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:40.899
they made a profit of $55.71.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.879
So summary, what you can see here is that from this elegant schema,

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.480
we were able to get facts and metrics from our fact table,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.270
which is what we did here in the second query with our customer transactions.

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:58.789
Also, information about our customers that will allow us to do more in-depth

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.160
analytics to get answers to business questions

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.010
by utilizing our facts and dimension tables.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.649
So again here, we were able to get a quick answer,

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.914
a fact, something true,

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:15.915
which is that the stores sold $55.71 of merchandise.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:19.365
We've got that quickly from our fact table.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.514
Then here, we learned something about our customer.

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:23.229
We learned our customer,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.075
this is the item that they purchased,

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.990
and that they're actually not a rewards member.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.819
So maybe that's somebody that we need to reach out

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.384
to and get them in our rewards program.

00:05:31.384 --> 00:05:33.334
Then here, at the end of the demo,

00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:34.669
I'm going to drop all my tables.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.050
Again, I'm going to close my cursor.

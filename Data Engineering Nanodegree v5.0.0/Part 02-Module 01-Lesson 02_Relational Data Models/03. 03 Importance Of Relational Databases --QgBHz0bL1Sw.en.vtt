00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
So, let's talk about the importance of relational databases.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.105
So, a little bit of history here.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:13.335
The concept of relational databases was invented in about 1969 by researchers at IBM.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.005
Edgar R. Codd was the lead researcher.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.809
He proposed 12 rules of what makes

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.919
the database management system a true relational system.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.825
We won't go over each rule,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:29.189
but I want to focus here on rule one because it's particularly important for this course.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.740
Rule one, the information rule.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.299
All information in a relational database is represented explicitly at

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.309
the logical level in exactly one way by values and tables.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.065
Rule one, is what we're trying to achieve with data modeling.

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:48.289
Remember, this is all abstract concepts of

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.479
relational modeling and what makes a system a valid relational model.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.059
So, why is the relational model important?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.245
Standardization of the data model.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:01.729
It takes work and effort to get your data transformed into the rows and columns format.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.679
But once you do this, your data is in

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.519
standardized and we'll be able to be query with SQL.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:10.744
Number two, flexibility in adding and altering tables.

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:14.045
Relational database gives you the flexibility to add tables,

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:16.670
alter tables, and add or remove data.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.370
Remember, these are the basics of what makes a database also a relational model.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.435
Data integrity. Data integrity is the backbone of using relational model.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.100
You'll remember from lesson one,

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.155
we talked about this quite extensively.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.049
Strong data typing ensures data that does

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.469
not fit the model will not be inserted causing corruption.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.275
Number four, Standard Query Language.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:44.585
Standard language can be used to access the data with a predefined language.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:49.509
Simplicity. Then finally, intuitive organization.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.490
The most important benefit for us to remember,

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.719
is that data is systematically stored and modeled,

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.864
and that the modeling process is an intuitive process.

00:01:58.864 --> 00:02:01.104
If you've created a spreadsheet in Excel,

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.570
you have created tables and modeled your data.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.169
It was so natural,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.735
you didn't even think that you were doing data modeling but you really were.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:12.980
More complicated systems require more intense thought and experimentation,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.060
but the basics are really the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
All right. So, now we're going to move into a new topic,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.570
we're leaving the denormalization and normalization.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.240
But these still have much to do with that again because those are

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.050
the most important concepts in data modelling for relational databases.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.570
So, this will have to do with that,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.109
but it's a little bit, it's utilizing those concepts.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.739
So, we're going to talk about fact and dimension tables.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.909
So, these work together to create an organized data model.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.664
While fact and dimension tables are not created differently in the DDL,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:36.314
their conceptual and extremely important for organization.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:39.409
So, again these are different tables you create in

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.544
the sense that you're going to do a different create table statement,

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.719
but they are different in the fact of how

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.914
we're conceptually understanding our data model.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:52.804
So, again fact and dimension tables work together to solve business problems.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:57.484
You will find at least one or more fact tables for each dimension table.

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:02.774
They are created the same way as a conceptual concept of data modelling.

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:07.780
Fact and dimension table concepts will help us understand star and snowflake schemas,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.549
and we'll get to that in the next couple of slides.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.655
Fact tables consists of measurements,

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.625
metrics or facts in a business process.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:19.385
Fact tables are made up of facts.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:21.800
Events that have actually happened.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.224
Think of a customer transaction and how much they spent.

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:28.309
That transaction ID might be used as a key in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.500
a dimension table to tell us more about the customers and the individual items bought.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.269
Fact tables can be aggregations of data,

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:40.229
but are not meant to be updated in place like a dimension table would.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.640
Fact tables normally have ints or numbers and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.405
we'll see an example coming up. Dimension table.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:50.435
A structure that categorizes facts and measures

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.590
in order to enable users to answer business questions.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.460
Dimensions are people, products, places, and time.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.079
Dimension tables are all the other pieces of

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.644
information that are not included in the fact table.

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:06.439
Customer information, information about products et cetera.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.889
Normally, textual information or numbers that are

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.609
not used for analysis like year or date.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.740
Each dimension table will have

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.475
one or more fact tables joined together with a foreign key.

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:22.085
Implementing different schemas.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.909
Building off of our conceptual knowledge of fact and dimension tables,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.849
the schema that fits with this is the star schema.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.555
So, two of the most popular because of their simplicity,

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:38.450
data marts schemas for data warehouses are the star schema and snowflake schema.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.039
This is building off of our conceptual knowledge of the fact and dimension tables,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.359
and the schema that fits with this which is the star schema.

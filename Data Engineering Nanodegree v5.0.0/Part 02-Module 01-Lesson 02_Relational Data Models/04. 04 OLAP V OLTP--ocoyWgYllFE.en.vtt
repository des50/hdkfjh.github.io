00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
A quick note on the difference between

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:09.855
Online Analytical Processing or OLAP or OLTP, Online Transaction Processing.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.065
Online Analytical Processing or OLAP.

00:00:13.064 --> 00:00:18.929
Database optimization for these workloads allow for complex analytics and ad hoc queries.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.399
These types of databases are optimized for read.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.894
Online Transactional Processing, OLTP.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:32.700
Databases optimized for these workloads allow for less complex queries in large volumes.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.375
The types of queries for these databases are read,

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.085
insert, update, and delete.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.844
So, let's go through an example so we can understand the difference between the two.

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.994
OLAP query will tell you how many shoes,

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:47.054
last week, were sold in stores in California.

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.179
You can see that it's already an aggregation that you'd have to do to get that data.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.869
You're doing analytics and aggregations on your data.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.000
Those are OLAP queries.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.945
An OLTP query will tell you the price of the shoes.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:04.700
Imagine just doing a select star on a particular table and getting back a result.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.640
OLAP queries will have little aggregations,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.000
really if any, while OLTP will heavily focus on aggregations.

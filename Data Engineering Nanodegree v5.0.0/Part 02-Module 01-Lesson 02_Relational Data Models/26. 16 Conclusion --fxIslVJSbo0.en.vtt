00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
So what did we learn? We learned what is a relational database?

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.740
We learned about what makes a database a relational database,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.035
and cobs 12 rules of relational database design.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:13.890
We learned about the difference between different types of workloads for databases that

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.969
they use the OLTP and the OLAP type of workloads.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:19.739
We learned about normalization,

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.774
which is the process of database normalization and normal forms.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:27.029
We walked through a demo on this process and did an exercise.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.500
Denormalization.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.785
We learned about denormalization and when it should be used.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.729
We will use this information a lot in our next section.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.859
We learned about facts and dimension tables as

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.789
a concept and how to apply that toward data modeling.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.804
Star and SnowFlake Schema.

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:45.500
We learned about how the Star SnowFlake Schemas use the concept of fact and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.625
dimension tables to make getting values out of your data easier.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.628
Remember that data modeling is a skill,

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:56.765
and that is and should be independent of any type of database you're working with.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.109
Once you have these skills,

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.924
you'll be able to transfer these skills to any database you are working with.

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:05.039
Until the next lesson, thank you.

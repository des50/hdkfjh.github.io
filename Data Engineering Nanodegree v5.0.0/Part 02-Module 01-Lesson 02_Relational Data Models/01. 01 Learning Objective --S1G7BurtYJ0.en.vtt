00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
In lesson two, we're going to focus on data modeling with relational databases.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.889
Students will be learning the fundamentals of how to do

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:11.504
relational data modeling by focusing on normalization,

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:15.179
denormalization, fact tables, dimension tables,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.995
and different schema models.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.195
Again, I just want to make sure everyone knows that really want to have

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:25.980
a strong understanding of normalization and denormalization.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.339
Those are the biggest heaviest topics we're going to discuss today.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.130
So, really make sure you take the time to make sure you fully understand these topics.

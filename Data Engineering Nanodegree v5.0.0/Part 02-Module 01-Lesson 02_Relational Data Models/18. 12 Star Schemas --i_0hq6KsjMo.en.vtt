00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
The star schema is the simplest style of data marts schemas.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.089
The star schema consists of

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.280
one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.644
and this is one of the most widely used schemas in the industry.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:18.855
So, why would we use a star schema?

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.995
It gets its name from the physical model representing a star shape.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.339
So, a fact table is at its center,

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.539
that's here, and the dimension tables surround the fact table.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.685
These are here, here,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.910
and here, and those represent the star points.

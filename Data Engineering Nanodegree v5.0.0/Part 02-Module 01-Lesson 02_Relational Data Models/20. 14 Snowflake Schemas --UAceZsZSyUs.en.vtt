00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
So now, let's talk about the snowflake schema.

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.990
This is a logical arrangement of tables in a multi-dimensional database

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.205
represented by centralized fact table which are connected to multiple dimensions.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:15.314
So, it's a complex snowflake shapes that

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.318
emerges when the dimensions of a snowflake schema are elaborated,

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.524
having multiple levels of relationships,

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:24.209
and child tables with multiple parents.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.880
So again, here we have one fact table,

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.695
and then the dimension table,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.940
and then other dimension tables that are radiating off of that.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.460
So, the snowflake versus the star schema.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.785
So, the star schema is a special simplified case of the snowflake schema.

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:43.899
Star schema does not allow for one to many relationships,

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.149
which is what we saw that you're able to do with the snowflake schema.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.619
The snowflake schema is more normalized than the star schema,

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.719
but it's normally only in first normal form or second normal form.

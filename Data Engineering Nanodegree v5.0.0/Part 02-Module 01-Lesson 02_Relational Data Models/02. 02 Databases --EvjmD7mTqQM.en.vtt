00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
So, first, we're going to go through just a little bit of definitions and

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.580
history before we get into some of the fundamentals of what we're going to talk about.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.705
So, let's start with a few definitions to make sure we're all on the same page.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.800
A database is a set of related data and the way it is organized.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.179
Access to this data is usually provided by a database management system.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.164
So, what is a database management system?

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:28.109
This consists of computer software that allows users to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.100
interact with the database and provides access to all of that data.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.170
Because of the close relationship,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.719
the term database is often used to refer to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.699
both the database and the database management system.
